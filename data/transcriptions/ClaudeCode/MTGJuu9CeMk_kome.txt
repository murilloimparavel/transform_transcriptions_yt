Okay, so in this lesson we're going to 
talk about two things that Claude Code 
can do. Planning and thinking, which are 
both two very different things. Thinking 
is when you ask Claude code to think 
about a solution before writing any 
code. And planning is when Claude puts 
together its own plan of action on how 
it intends to implement some features 
and asks you to approve it. So let's 
start with planning. And you might have 
caught a glimpse of this at the end of 
the last lesson where we used Alt plus M 
to cycle through the autoedit option 
down here. So, if I press AltM once, I 
turn on the accept edits feature. But if 
I press it twice, we go into the 
planning mode instead. Now, planning 
mode is good for when you're giving 
Claude code a task which has a wide 
breadth of changes over several 
different files. But where individually 
each of those changes might not 
necessarily be complex. They could be, 
but maybe not. Still, the scope of those 
changes might be quite wide. And with a 
plan, it makes easier for Claude Code to 
stay on track and complete each task in 
order. So then let's keep planning mode 
on and we're going to ask it to do the 
following. Can you make a custom 
component for an avatar? No pick only 
initial and find any places in the 
project where it can replace avatar like 
templates. So I'm going to press enter 
now and see what it comes up with. 
So first of all, it's analyzing the 
codebase to understand where an avatar 
component could be useful. So it's 
searching things. It's reading different 
files. 
All right. And now it's come up with a 
plan right here. So if we scroll to the 
top, you can see it's discovered avatar 
like implementations in the blog system 
in a few different places in the blog 
post cards and also in recent activity 
in the sidebar. So it's detected those 
and then it's proposing this avatar 
component. So it's in the correct place 
inside the UI folder, then an avatar 
folder, then avatar.tsx. 
So, it's going to have the initial based 
avatar, which is going to be the first 
letter from their name. Multiple sizes, 
color variants, consistent styling. So, 
it's kind of following the same pattern 
as the button component, which is nice. 
So, for the implementation plan, it's 
going to first of all create the avatar 
component, then replace the existing 
avatar code in the blog post cards, and 
it even specifies exactly where it's 
going to do that for us. Then it says 
it's going to work on the blog sidebar 
and it's going to add the avatar to 
individual blog posts as well inside the 
blog post details page. Then it's going 
to create a test file to follow the 
existing button test patterns so it can 
be tested on the avatar component as 
well. And then we're going to add a link 
to the avatar preview in the header 
navigation. So you can go ahead and 
accept this plan or you can accept the 
plan but then keep manually approving 
any edits or you can say no and keep 
planning and provide feedback for the 
plan so it adjusts the plan. So I'm 
going to select the first option up here 
which is yes and auto accept edits. 
Okay. So down here it is saying it wants 
to run this bash command npm run test 
and I want to select the second option 
which is yes and don't ask me again for 
npm run test commands. And when I do 
that, it should automatically go into 
the settings.local file right here, 
which we can see it does. Awesome. 
All right. So, this time it's trying to 
link the file. And again, I'm going to 
choose the second option down here. 
Okay. And then finally, it looks like 
it's done. So, it's checked off 
everything from the plan it created. All 
the tests are passing. And if we close 
this off and take a look over here, we 
should be able to see that new avatar 
folder. And okay, so it's actually 
created a full page for the avatar. Now, 
maybe that was in the plan and I didn't 
fully understand it. I thought it was 
just going to add it to the preview 
page. But you see, this is where 
sometimes AI can go wrong. Claude Code, 
Copilot, whatever you're using. So, it's 
important to keep it on track. Either 
way, it doesn't so much matter for this 
particular task. Um, it's just to 
preview it after all. And I can delete 
this page afterwards. But you can see 
we've got this component folder down 
here, avatar. We've got the test file 
and the avatar component itself. So, 
we've got the default size right here 
set to medium. The variant is gradient. 
But we have these different variant 
options up here in different sizes as 
well for the props. Um we have the size 
classes, the variant classes, and then 
down here we have the avatar itself. 
Okay. So let's see if this works in the 
browser. All right. So you can see added 
the avatar page and the link to the 
header. So it did get a little bit 
trigger happy. And now if we take a look 
down here, we can see all the different 
variants that we have, the different 
sizes, even use cases down here. So I 
think this is all really really nice. 
It's created that component and shown us 
different ways we can use it. Now if I 
go to the actual blog part of the 
website, you can see it's now using that 
avatar here. It's using it down here as 
well inside recent activity. And if I 
was to select an individual blog like 
this one right here, you can see we have 
the avatar on the blog details as well. 
So, the only thing it did really that I 
didn't want it to do was place the 
avatar link up here and create a full 
page for the avatars when I specified in 
a claw.md file that they should go 
inside the preview uh file. So, maybe I 
wasn't specific enough. Maybe I looked 
over the plan too quickly. I don't know. 
But this is easy to rectify. I can just 
delete these pages, no problem. So I 
just told claw code to remove the avatar 
page and instead put all of the samples 
inside the preview page and it's gone 
ahead and done that which is good. I've 
also updated the claw MD file with this 
more specific instruction at the bottom 
which says now when making new page 
components always had a link to that 
page in the header. So it did this for 
our UI component. So I added this bit on 
only do this for page components not UI 
or other dropin components. So, I guess 
this is a lesson in instructions and 
also in how you have to be specific in 
what you want Claude Code to do. Okay, 
so that all work pretty well and I think 
having plan mode turned on probably 
helped Claude Code complete the task 
correctly. Now, it may still have done 
so without planning mode on, but when it 
is turned on, I find it's worked to stay 
on track more for tasks with a wider 
scope. And arguably the scope wasn't 
huge for this task, but it still 
involved making a component, testing the 
component, looking for places it can be 
used, editing those files, etc. Anyway, 
now let's look at thinking mode. Now, 
thinking mode is good when you want 
claude code to work on something that 
includes more complex logic. So, not 
necessarily a wide scope like planning 
mode is for. It could be quite a narrow 
scope, but one where the logic is more 
complex. For example, I might want to 
implement a comment system for the blog 
where users can comment on the blogs. 
And that would include perhaps some 
thought about exactly how it should be 
done, what services, if any, should be 
used, what React components need to be 
made, what additional pages might need 
to be made, what about live updates and 
how does this get structured and fit 
well together in this application. So 
for something like this, you would turn 
on extended thinking mode, which does 
consume more tokens, but it allows the 
model to reason and think more about how 
to complete something in a way that 
actually works. Now, to be honest, we're 
entering into the realms of vibe coding 
when we ask the AI to implement a whole 
system like this. And I would personally 
break this down into smaller chunks or 
tasks and work on each one one at a time 
with Claude code so I could more easily 
guide the AI to do what I want it to do. 
But for the sake of this lesson and to 
demonstrate thinking mode, we'll run 
with this example. So let me paste in 
this prompt right here first of all 
which says implement a comment system 
into the application where users can 
authenticate and then comment on blog 
posts. think hard about this 
implementation, including the database, 
schema, authentication services, 
moderation, and real-time updates. I'm 
also going to keep planning mode on so I 
can see the plan that Claude code makes 
as well. Now, I'm triggering think mode 
in this prompt by using the word think 
right here. And whenever Claude code 
sees that in your prompt, that word, 
it's going to use extended thinking 
mode. So then, let me press enter now 
and we'll see what Claude code does. 
All right. So already in this kind of 
gray color, you can see it's thinking 
and this is the thinking process that it 
has kind of behind the scenes. So by 
using that think keyword in our prompt, 
we've enabled this thinking mode. 
All right. And now it's come up with the 
plan. So that took a little bit longer, 
but it's because Claude Code was 
thinking. So, this is the plan and it's 
quite extensive. There's a lot of steps 
involved. All right. And anything in a 
kind of faded gray up here. And this is 
all of Claude's thinking. And it also 
prefixes that if you like with this 
little thinking uh text right here. So, 
every time it's thinking about 
something, you'll see that. All right. 
Thinking. Thinking. So, it thinks quite 
a lot. So, then I'm not going to go 
ahead with these changes because that 
would drastically change my project 
right now. And I'd also have to set up 
some external services as well. And 
again, because I wouldn't normally let 
AI completely loose on tasks like this, 
I don't know which direction it's going 
to go off in. Instead, I would break it 
down into logical steps. Maybe taking 
each of these checkpoints in the plan 
and working on them individually. That 
way, I can stay in a loop, check the 
code in small steps manually, and make 
changes myself where I need to along the 
way. Doing everything at once sometimes 
makes things harder in the long run. And 
I find that pretty soon you're out of 
the loop and you get sucked into this 
kind of full-on vibe coding experience 
where you're just asking Claw to fix 
everything and ignoring the code 
completely. So, I'm going to choose not 
to do this now. But just very quickly 
before we finish this video, I want to 
mention that Claude Code does have 
different levels of thinking that you 
can activate. In the example I just 
used, I said, "Think hard." But you can 
also just say, "Think," and that's going 
to trigger a smaller amount of thinking 
and reasoning. Likewise, you can go the 
other way by saying, "Think harder," and 
that's going to crank the thinking up 
even more. And if you want to go all in, 
then you can ask Claude to ultra think, 
which activates the hardest thinking 
mode it has. But again, remember that 
thinking consumes more tokens, and the 
harder you ask Claw Code to think, the 
more tokens it's going to use up. All 
right then. So now we know a little bit 
about planning and thinking. Next up 
we'll talk about commands.
