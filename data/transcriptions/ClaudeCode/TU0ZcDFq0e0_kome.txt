Okay then gang, in this lesson we're 
going to talk about the tools available 
to Claude code out of the box and also 
how we can give project Y permissions to 
Claude to use certain tools. So whenever 
we ask Claude code to do something, it 
generally uses some kind of built-in 
tool to perform an action. For example, 
to read a file, it would use a read 
tool. To edit a single file, it uses the 
edit tool. To run a bash command, it 
uses the bash tool. And we don't need to 
reference these tools when we send our 
prompts or messages. Claude Code knows 
when it needs to use certain tools based 
on your instructions. Now, you might 
have noticed that when I've asked Claude 
to do some of these things in past 
lessons, like edit a file, it asks me 
for permission to do that thing before 
it actually does it. And we can either 
say yes or no, depending on whether we 
want to grant that permission or not. On 
the anthropic docs, it lists all of 
these built-in tools available to Claude 
Code, and it outlines what each one 
does. It also shows you whether each of 
these tools requires permission before 
it gets used. For example, the bash and 
the edit tools, they do require 
permission, but read doesn't. So, if I 
ask Claude Code to look at a file, it's 
not going to prompt me to give it 
access, but if I ask it to change a 
file, then it will do. There's a tool 
down here, by the way, called to-do, 
right? and it uses that tool to make 
these little checklists of things it 
needs to do when you give it a task to 
kind of keep itself on track. It's 
pretty nice and you're going to see them 
quite often as you're working with 
Claude Code. Now, again, you don't need 
to remember the names of all of these 
tools and what they do because Claude 
Code is designed so it knows what tool 
to use and when automatically, but it is 
good to know the kinds of things that 
you can do out of the box. So, I will 
leave this link down below the video. 
All right, then. So, let's try doing 
something that requires permission, like 
editing a file. I'm going to ask Claude 
code to add another theme variable to 
the CSS file called highlight, which 
needs to be a pastel yellow color. I've 
also referenced the global CSS file 
right here as well for context. And when 
we send this off, as soon as Claude Code 
figures out that it needs to edit a 
file, it's going to ask our permission 
to do it. Okay, so now it's edited the 
file, or rather it wants to edit the 
file, it's asking us right here, do you 
want to make this edit to global.css? 
So, we have three options. We can select 
yes at the top, no at the bottom, and 
you can give further instruction if you 
want to, or this middle option, yes, and 
don't ask me again this session. So, 
we'll go through that in a second, but 
for now, I'm just going to select yes to 
give it permission to make this edit. 
And because it's making multiple edits 
to the file, it's asking me to make 
further changes. So, it changed one 
line, then it's going to somewhere else 
in the file, and it's making another 
edit. So, again, I'm going to press yes. 
And it looks like it wants to update a 
third time. So again, we're going to uh 
press yes. And now it's all done. So for 
a simple set of edits there to just a 
single file, we had to grant permission 
three times. Right now, let's try doing 
a commit using the bash tool. So I'm 
going to ask clause code this time. Can 
you make a commit? Like so. And this is 
going to do a few things. It's going to 
add the files to the staging area, then 
make the commit with a commit message. 
So you can see right here it wants to 
use bash. It's looking for any changes 
and then eventually it wants to use this 
command get add. Now this time when 
claude code asks for permission I'm 
going to choose this second option which 
is yes and don't ask me again for git 
add commands. Now if I choose this 
option then it's going to carry on and 
do this git command and it's also going 
to create a new file called 
settings.local.json 
inside a do.claude claude folder in the 
project. And inside that file, there's 
going to be a permissions object with a 
property inside it called allow. And 
that allow property should be an array 
of allowed commands for the project. 
Meaning, if Claude Code tried to run 
this bash command again in the project, 
it wouldn't need to ask for permission 
because we've allowed it here. So, as 
Claude Code asks you for permission to 
do different things, you can select that 
second option to add the command to the 
allowed list inside the settings file. 
You can also manually add commands in 
there yourself as well. And this would 
just be for your workflow, by the way. 
You wouldn't commit this file and push 
it up. Something else you can do is 
press Alt and M on Windows. It might be 
control and M on a Mac. And that's going 
to turn on this accept edits feature. 
And now when you ask Claude Code to make 
changes, it's not going to ask for 
permission to do that, to edit your 
files for this chat session. If you 
start a new session, it will ask you 
again until you turn this feature on. 
You can turn it off again by hitting Alt 
+ M twice. So then that's a quick 
breakdown of tools, permissions for 
those tools, and how we can edit those 
permissions for the project inside the 
settings file. Next up, we're going to 
look at how Claude Code can plan and 
think for more complex tasks.
