All right then gang. In this course, 
we're going to be diving into claude 
code which is an AI powered agentic 
coding tool created by Enthropic which 
you can use to analyze, plan, write and 
edit code within your projects. Similar 
to other agentic coding tools like 
copilot or cursor or windsurf. But 
whereas those other tools typically come 
with a user interface embedded within 
code editors themselves, claude code 
lives directly in the terminal and we 
interact with it through the terminal. 
And that means it can integrate with 
your existing development workflow a 
little more seamlessly without forcing 
you to switch your IDE. On top of that, 
you can use cloud code within GitHub 
workflows to automate code reviews on 
pull requests to provide feedback as 
well as have it work independently on 
open issues in your repository. I also 
think it sets itself apart in its 
ability to really understand the 
codebase of whatever project I use it 
on. And in my own personal experience, I 
found the code it generates to be more 
tailored and appropriate on a project by 
project basis. So, in this series, we'll 
be diving into how to set up Claude Code 
on your computer, how to provide it 
context and learn about your codebase, 
have it generate code for us in a 
targeted and specific way, and we'll 
also set it to work on our GitHub repo 
to work autonomously on simple issues 
and books. On top of that, we'll be 
looking at MCP servers to provide 
additional tools to Claude code, custom 
commands for common tasks, and we'll 
even try spinning up a sub agent to work 
alongside Claude. And just to clarify, 
this will not be a VI coding course 
where we just let the AI loose to code 
everything for us. In my opinion, that's 
not a productive workflow, and it can 
lead to more bugs, sloppy code, and 
technical debt, making the code much 
harder to maintain in the future. So, 
we'll be taking a more hands-on 
approach, coding alongside Claude on 
tasks and features, which are more 
narrow and focused in scope, and also 
checking the work it does as we go. And 
I feel this approach generally keeps the 
code cleaner, less buggy, and I stay 
fully in the loop and in control, 
dipping into the code to make manual 
changes where I need or want to. Anyway, 
before we do anything, we'll need to 
install Cloud Code and sign up for a 
plan. 
[Music] 
Okay, then. So, I'm on the Cloud Code 
homepage, and if you scroll down a 
little bit, you're eventually going to 
see an npm command we can run to install 
it on our computer. Now, it used to be 
that on Windows you would have to 
install it via WSL, but now you don't 
have to, and you can just run this 
command directly in your Windows 
terminal, so copy that for later. You'll 
also need to sign up for an account and 
choose a pricing plan, which you can do 
right here on the pricing page. So, you 
can use Claude Code with a pro plan or a 
max plan. The free plan gives you access 
to the Claude models on the web and the 
desktop app, but not Claude Code itself, 
at least not at the time of recording 
this video. The pro plan is $17 a month 
and for that you get some fairly decent 
usage limits which reset I think every 5 
hours and you do also get a warning when 
you're nearly reaching your limit. You 
also get access to more models like 
Sonic 4 and Opus 4.1 but the Opus model 
does eat through your limits much 
faster. So I default to Sonic for most 
things. The Max plan is way more 
expensive but it gives you more usage 
and access to all the latest features as 
they ship. So sign up, choose a plan and 
then crack open your terminal. All right 
then. So inside a terminal now we want 
to run that command we just copied npm 
install g to install this globally 
atanthropicai/claude 
code. So press enter to install this. 
Okay. And then the next thing you want 
to do once you've installed that is 
navigate to a project that you want to 
work with claude on. So I've already 
navigated to this one called shinobi. 
This is what we're going to be using for 
this course. And then you can type 
claude and press enter. And this starts 
up a claude session inside this project 
for you. Now, when you first start using 
Claude, the first time you use it, it's 
going to ask you a few questions. It's 
going to ask you for a mode. So, I'm 
going to go for dark mode. And then it's 
going to say you can log in using the 
console account, which is API usage, or 
with a subscription. Now, I showed you 
those plans a moment ago, and I've 
already got a pro subscription. So, I'm 
going to sign up with this sign in 
rather, and that's going to open a 
browser for you, which I'm going to 
authorize off screen. 
And now you can see it says login 
successful. Press enter to continue. And 
then it says here Claude can make 
mistakes. So always review Claude's 
responses especially code. And it says 
due to prompt injection risks only use 
it with code you trust. All right. So 
press enter to continue. And then when 
you first start Claude in a particular 
project, it's going to ask you if you 
trust the files in the folder. Yes, I 
do. And now we can start chatting with 
Claude. So just try asking it about your 
current project. That's what I'm going 
to do. And this is good if you ever 
start work on a project that you've not 
worked on before. It could be your 
friends or colleagues. You can just say, 
can you provide me with a summary of 
what this project is 
and press enter. And you can see right 
now it's reading different files. It's 
looking at the codebase. 
And now it's come with a response. So 
you can see it's a simple blog 
application built as a starter project 
for a claude code crash course which is 
pretty cool. It's detected that from my 
readme file. I think it's a nextjsbased 
web application that serves as a 
practical learning platform for AI 
assisted development. So there's a text 
stack here uh learning focus areas etc. 
Now, personally, I like to see the code 
that I'm working on as Claude or any 
other coding tool makes changes to it 
because then I can easily check any 
edited or new code and also go into the 
weeds myself to work on the code 
manually when I want to or need to. So, 
for this series, I'm going to be running 
Claude Code in the terminal within VS 
Code. And when we run the Claude command 
inside here, Claude is automatically 
going to install the Claude Code 
extension for VS Code. And that allows 
it to integrate more seamlessly within 
the editor by adding a few extra 
features like diff viewing, adding text 
selection as context, um some keyboard 
shortcuts, and also active tab awareness 
so that Claude can see exactly what file 
we're working on. Now, if the extension 
doesn't automatically get installed, 
then you can manually install it by 
coming to the extensions tab and 
searching for Claude Code. Anyway, I've 
got that same Shinobi project open in VS 
Code, which is the project I'm going to 
be working on for the duration of this 
course. And the first thing I'm going to 
do is run the project by opening the new 
terminal over here and then typing npm 
rundev. That's going to spin up a local 
dev server. So, we can preview this 
thing in a browser using localhost port 
3000. So, then on the homepage, we've 
got two buttons right here. One to go to 
the blog and one to go to the preview 
page for new UI components. So, if we go 
to the preview page, first of all, you 
can see that I've already added a few 
different things to this page like 
headings, regular text, button 
components, etc. And during this course, 
I'm going to get Claude Code to make 
some more reusable UI components for me 
and then add them to this page so that 
we can preview them before we use them 
in the actual project. Now, if we go 
back and then go to the blog section, we 
can see a really simple blog design 
where we list out a bunch of blogs and 
they're all coming from High Graph, 
which is a headless CMS, and also a 
sidebar over here with some dummy data 
inside it. There's also a light and dark 
mode, which we can toggle with this 
little icon in the header. So, this is 
the project we're going to be working on 
with Claude Code, but you can use 
whatever project that you want. It 
doesn't really matter. What I would say 
is to begin with, make sure it's a 
throwaway project in case things go 
horribly wrong or at least use version 
control so you can get rid of any 
unwanted changes. All right, so before 
we move on and start doing any real work 
with Claude Code, I just want to set up 
a few things. First, I'm going to use a 
special command Claude Code gives to us, 
which is forward slash terminal setup. 
And when we run this command, it's going 
to install the shift plus enter 
keybinding for new lines when we're 
chatting with Claude code. So if you 
wanted to start a new line in the chat 
window, you'd press shift and enter. 
Next, to make sure I don't end up 
wrecking this starter project, I'm going 
to ask Claude to switch to a new branch 
called Claude edits. And Claude can do 
this, by the way. It has knowledge about 
your local git repository and it can run 
bash commands to do things like stage 
and commit changes, switch branches, 
merge branches, and even resolve 
conflicts. And you can also ask it about 
commits or branches or changes made 
between commits. And it's going to be 
able to look that up for you. Anyway, 
when we tell it to do any of these 
things, it's going to show us the bash 
command it wants to run and ask us for 
permission to run it. We'll say yes for 
now to let it run that command and then 
we'll end up on that new branch so that 
we can start making some edits. So now 
we've got cla uh claude code installed, 
configured, and ready to go inside VS 
Code. In the next lesson, we're going to 
start making some actual code edits, and 
we'll also talk about adding memory to 
Claude using a claude.md file. And by 
the way, if you want early access to the
