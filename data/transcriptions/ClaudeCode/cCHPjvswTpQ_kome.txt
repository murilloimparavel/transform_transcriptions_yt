All right then gang, we have reached the 
end of the series and I really hope 
you've enjoyed it and maybe you're 
seeing the benefit of adding Claude code 
into your own development workflow. Now 
I do want to end the course on a few 
final thoughts, words of caution and 
just a little bit of advice for using 
claude code and also some shortcuts and 
tips near the end of the video as well. 
So first of all, and I think I've 
stressed this throughout the videos 
quite a lot already, always check the 
code yourself. AI can make mistakes 
sometimes, so be sure it's correct. 
Don't automatically assume everything it 
does is right. Checking the code 
yourself also helps to keep you in the 
loop, understand your code base, and 
know how everything is fitting together. 
And that's going to really help in the 
future if you do ever need to do some 
manual debugging or code edits. 
Secondly, context is key when you're 
using any kind of AI tool like Claude 
Code. And I don't just mean bombard the 
model with context about everything. I 
mean be smart about your context. Keep 
it focused, concise where you can, and 
keep the context history lean where 
possible to keep the model on track. 
Don't be afraid to clear the context or 
start a new session if it ever gets 
bloated. And as a rule of thumb, I tend 
to clear the context and start over 
whenever I work on a new feature or 
task. And finally, I would say don't 
rely on AI to do everything for you. 
Yes, it can be good as a coding 
assistant and loads more things. I'd 
probably compare it to maybe having a 
junior or even a mid-level developer 
working alongside you. But if you use it 
too often and rely on it for every 
single problem, it's going to turn you 
into a lazier programmer who might not 
learn new skills and even forget current 
ones because you're not using them. And 
on that same note, I would also say 
this. A lot of coders right now think AI 
is going to replace them. And I think 
that's not true for several reasons 
right now. I do think the way we code 
will be different and AI will certainly 
play a big role in whatever the 
landscape looks like in the future. But 
I don't think, at least not yet, it's in 
any position to completely replace web 
developers. And in fact, I think AI just 
brings more opportunities to developers. 
Think of all the new types of 
applications and programs that are being 
developed that incorporate AI. MCP 
servers, agents, custom AI integrations, 
even developing sites and APIs with AI 
usage and security in mind. All those 
things are now being developed and I 
think that brings a whole new level of 
opportunity for web developers to 
specialize in. I also think because we 
will be getting a whole sway of 
applications built almost entirely using 
AI. Unfortunately, there's still going 
to be a big call for coders who can go 
into the weeds, understand the code, and 
manually work on it. And for all these 
reasons, I think learning to code is 
arguably more important now than it was 
before. Anyway, now my pattern wisdom is 
out of the way. Let's end on a few 
shortcuts that we can use within Claude 
Code to make life working with it a 
little bit easier. All right, so first 
of all, you can use the up and down 
arrow keys to cycle through previous 
prompts to see them if you want to send 
a previous prompt again. Um, there's 
another one. If you press escape, then 
you can clear out the chat. Also, if you 
go into something, say we use a tool 
like or not a tool, sorry, a command 
like MCP, you can always press escape to 
exit out of these windows and it goes 
back to the chat. Um, you can also use 
the question mark to go into bash mode. 
So now you can run bash commands. So for 
example, I could say get status and it's 
going to run that command for us. 
Exactly. So it's on branch main. And you 
can double escape. I think I might have 
shown this in a previous lesson, but you 
can double escape to go to previous 
sections of the chats. So, I could go 
back to this one if I wanted to, or this 
one, and it's going to take me back to 
that point in the chat, and it's going 
to clear out any history beyond that. 
So, if I press double escape now, then 
you can see there's no chats after this 
current one. And down here at the 
bottom, there is this little hint here 
that says question mark for shortcuts. 
So, if I press question mark, you're 
going to see some of those shortcuts 
that we've seen as well. So this was the 
bash mode I just showed you. This for 
tools, this for file path for adding 
context and this to memorize something 
inside the claude.md file. Okay then my 
friends. So that just about wraps it up. 
If you enjoyed this series, please don't 
forget to give the videos a thumbs up 
and subscribe to the channel. Maybe 
share the videos if you're feeling kind 
as well. And please let me know in the 
comments if you would like more Claude 
Code courses in the future. I have 
debated making a whole big master class 
about claude code where we use it to 
help build an entire application from 
scratch. So let me know if that's 
something you would like to see in the 
future. Anyway, thanks for watching and 
I'm going to see you all in the next 
series. So then my friends, I really 
really hope you enjoyed this series and 
you learned something along the way. If 
you did, please please please don't
