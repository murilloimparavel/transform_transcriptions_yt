All right. So, in the last lesson, we 
talked about the claude ND files, 
otherwise known as memory, which Claude 
code uses when you're asking it to do 
something. Now, it's able to do this 
because the claw.md file, gets added 
automatically as context to any claw 
code session like this one we've got 
going on now. But what do we mean when 
we say context? Well, just like in 
conversations with real people, 
responses are more accurate and 
appropriate from AI models when you 
provide additional relevant information 
or context to your prompts. Imagine I 
just said the word banana to you in a 
conversation without any additional 
context. You probably wouldn't know how 
to react and you would most likely think 
I'm quite strange. But if I said to you, 
first of all, my favorite fruit is a 
banana, then I've added context to that 
word, and you might still think I'm 
strange, but at least you know why I'm 
saying the word banana, and you could 
even respond with your own favorite 
fruit. The same is true when you're 
having a conversation with Claude Code 
or any other AI powered chat. If I just 
told Claude Code to fix the link, it 
probably won't know where to start or 
what link I'm referring to or even 
what's wrong with the link. But if I 
referenced a specific file or component 
where that broken link is as context to 
the prompt, then Claude's got a much 
better chance of knowing what I'm going 
on about. And the results are going to 
be much better because now instead of 
having to scan the entire codebase for 
some kind of broken link that it doesn't 
know about, it's going to find it right 
away in the file we added as context. So 
we can manually add files as context to 
Claude code by using the at symbol 
followed by a path to the file. For 
example, I could say at source and then 
back slashcomponents 
and then also back slash UI. And as I'm 
writing this, notice that we get some 
file options that appear down here, 
which I can just cycle through using my 
arrow keys to select a file. So I'm 
going to select this button component 
file and I'm going to shift on it so 
that it gets added to my chat right 
here. So now inside that button 
component, we have different variants, 
right? like primary, success, warning, 
etc. I'm going to add two more, which is 
just black and white variants for high 
contrast. So, I'm going to say add a 
black variant with white text and a 
white variant with black text. And then 
uh with black text rather, sorry. And 
then I'm going to hit enter. And because 
we provided the file as context, it's 
going to know to look at the variants in 
that file and add them in. If we didn't 
add the context, then it wouldn't know 
maybe which file or components to add 
the variants to. And now you can see 
it's asking us to make changes, which 
I'm going to accept. And then if I open 
up the file in a moment when it's 
completed this, we should hopefully see 
the black and white variance. So, let me 
cross this off. Oh, it's asking to make 
another change. So, let me press yes to 
do that. 
And now, if we open this file, we should 
be able to see those two new variants. 
Another way to give Claude code context 
of the file that you want to work on is 
by opening the file itself and just 
putting your cursor somewhere inside it. 
And when we do that, you can see the 
file name underneath the chat window 
over here, which tells us it's been 
added to the context. Now, if you close 
that file, well, it's still there. But 
that's because the cursor is still kind 
of active inside that file. But if you 
open a new file, just put your cursor 
inside that one instead, then it's going 
to update over here as well. Now, you 
can only add one file to the context 
this way, but you can add multiple files 
by using the at symbol several times in 
the prompt itself. Also, you can select 
a portion of code inside a file, and 
it's going to hone in and use that 
little section you've highlighted as 
context. And you can see that down here 
in the chat as well, that this amount of 
lines is selected. 
So, you can also add references using 
this at sign to claw. ND files. So if I 
wanted to reference a schema file for 
example for whenever Claude works with 
data modules, I could do and it would 
load that file up into the context then 
or I could reference a testing config 
file in here or anything else I think 
Claude Code should know when making 
edits to certain parts of the code. So 
that's how we add files as context using 
the at sign or opening the file 
manually. But we can also add images as 
context too. So, I've got a picture of a 
button over here with a 3D effect, and I 
want Claude Code to apply that kind of 
3D effect to our buttons. So, what I'm 
going to do is drag and drop the button 
file into the chat session over here. 
And now, it's added as context. Then, 
what I'm going to do is paste in a 
prompt, and it says, can you update the 
button design? Let's just make this more 
specific. We'll say button design in the 
button 
component 
to look more like the button on this 
image with a 3D effect keeping all of 
the color variants. I'm also going to 
reference the file in context as well by 
saying at source and then we want to go 
into components and let's do backslash 
components to do that. And then we want 
the button file down here. So, I'm going 
to tap on that to add it to the context 
as well. Then press enter. All right. 
So, I'm going to allow it to make these 
edits. 
And again, it wants to make some more 
edits. I'm going to press yes to allow 
it to do this. All right. And now it's 
changed it. Okay. And now in a browser, 
we can see those buttons look a lot more 
3D. It's added that 3D effect. It's also 
added, I think, a subtle gradient going 
from top to bottom. So, yeah, it's done 
a really good job there. So, we've seen 
now how to add context to prompts, which 
essentially gives Claude code more 
information about any given task. So, 
adding context when it's needed is 
really important. However, adding too 
much unnecessary context can lead to 
less accurate results. Now, on a prompt 
byprompt basis, you're probably not 
going to intentionally do that. If 
you're working on the button component, 
you most likely won't add 50 other 
unrelated files as context. However, it 
can happen unintentionally. So let me 
explain how first of all and then we'll 
look at some ways to combat that. So 
imagine we're working on a feature like 
a shopping basket and we provide clawed 
code with a bunch of different prompts 
and files as context over several 
different messages inside the session. 
Well, all of those files and messages 
including the AI model responses. 
They're all stored in context in the 
current chat session. And that means 
whenever you're sending new prompts, 
Claude codes got the entire chat history 
plus any additional context you manually 
added like files as context for the 
session. Now, that's okay while we're 
working on this feature because it is 
probably useful for Claude to know about 
that history and the changes that it's 
been making. But imagine we then get 
sidetracked because the button doesn't 
quite look right inside the shopping 
basket and we start asking Claude code 
to make UI changes to the button 
component which is I suppose a 
completely separate thing to the 
shopping basket. Yes, we might use the 
button on that section but largely the 
basket page is unrelated to the button 
component. So, if we started working on 
the button component in this chat, 
Claude code's going to still have all of 
that previous chat and file context 
about the basket page, which in respect 
to working on the button is pretty 
useless. And we're essentially giving 
Claude a bunch of useless context to 
read while it's working on the button. 
And that could confuse him. It might 
even start making inline edits to the 
button itself on the basket page, which 
isn't what we wanted. So, when we're 
working on a feature with claude code, 
it's always best to keep the context 
clean and focused on whatever we're 
working on and not let it get bloated 
with information that it doesn't need. 
So, how do we combat this? Well, there's 
a few ways. First of all, you could just 
exit the chat using the forward/exit 
command and then start a new one in the 
terminal by typing claude again and 
hitting enter. And then from inside any 
session, you can resume all the previous 
sessions by using the forward slashres 
command, which I'm going to show you 
later. But if you don't want to do that 
and you want to stay inside the same 
session, you've got essentially three 
options. You can use the clear command 
and that's going to clear the entire 
session history and context back to its 
original state. It will keep the claw MD 
files as context, but anything else that 
you manually added in the chat and any 
conversation history that all gets 
cleared. So, it's like deleting the chat 
and starting a fresh one, which might be 
useful if you fully completed a task and 
you want to move on to the next one. The 
other option or one other option should 
I say is to use a command called forward 
slashcompact. And this tells claw to 
look through the entire session history 
and context and compact it into a small 
summary and then just delete the rest. 
So that small summary of the session 
history will remain in the session 
context, but the rest gets deleted. So 
it reduces all of the context a lot. It 
squashes it right down. Now, I find this 
useful if I'm working on a single 
feature, but the session starts to get 
really long and the context bloated. And 
then I can just carry on with the same 
feature in the same session using that 
compact summary, and it's still going to 
be there as context. The third option is 
to tap escape twice in the chat window. 
And this lets you essentially rewind to 
a previous point in the session and 
remove all later chats and files from 
the context. So, this could be useful if 
you were working on a feature, maybe you 
got sidetracked by a bug or something 
else and you wanted to trim all of that 
last bit from the history in the 
context. So, you could do that. So, 
that's three approaches to keeping the 
context clean and focused. Now, let me 
show you them in action. All right. So, 
first of all, let's try double escape. 
So, press it twice like so. And you can 
see I can go back in the chat. Now, I 
cleared it earlier on. So that's why you 
see this clear and that's the beginning. 
But you could go back to an earlier 
point in the chat by just pressing enter 
on any one of these. Now I'm going to 
escape to get out of this because I 
don't want to do that just yet. Uh the 
next one I'm going to try is compact. So 
I'm going to use that compact command. 
And you can see also you can give this 
an additional argument right here or 
instructions as to how you would like 
this compacted. I'm not going to do 
that. I'm just going to press enter. 
And then you can see it's created a 
summary right here. And we can now have 
that in our context. But if we now press 
double escape, you can see this is the 
only thing left. So we have this which 
is the original one and then the compact 
command. So all the history has actually 
been cleared except for this bit of 
context that remains in the session. All 
right. So let me escape out of this. And 
then finally I'm going to use the clear 
command like so. And you can see here it 
says clear conversation history and free 
up context. I'm going to press enter and 
that's going to get rid of everything. 
So now if I press double escape, you can 
see there's no history in the chat. 
Awesome. I also mentioned that one 
option would be to exit out of the 
current chat using for/exit and then 
just pressing enter. So that's going to 
stop the session and dump you back in 
the regular terminal interface again. 
And if you start Claude up again by 
typing Claude and then hitting enter, 
it's going to start on a brand new chat 
session with zero context added to it 
except for that claw md file. So you can 
start working on your new feature 
straight away. And then if you wanted to 
resume a previous chat session, you can 
use the forward slashres command and 
then press enter. And that's going to 
show you all of the current chat 
sessions you have going on with Claude 
Code for this project, including when 
you last used that session, how many 
messages are in it, uh the branch it's 
working on, and a summary. So, I could 
select one of these, and then I get put 
back into that chat session with all of 
its previous context intact. Now, there 
is one more small thing I want to 
quickly mention when it comes to 
context, and that is something called 
the context window. And the context 
window represents how much context an AI 
model or tool can handle at once. It's 
measured in tokens where one token is I 
think about three or four characters in 
a word. Now the context window is 
generally different depending on which 
tools or models that you're using in 
Claude code. The context window is 
200,000 tokens at this point in time 
which is a fair amount. But if your 
sessions last a long time, have a lot of 
manually added context and back and 
forths, then that context window is 
eventually going to fill up. Claude Code 
actually tells you when you're 
approaching this limit as well by giving 
you a little message. And when that 
happens, I found the results to drop off 
a little bit. So if your session context 
is ever getting a bit bloated, remember 
those three things that we can do to 
reduce it. We can double escape to trim 
out any recent history and go back to a 
previous part of the chat session. We 
can use the forward slashcompact command 
to summarize the context and 
significantly reduce it. Or we can use 
the forward slashclear command to 
completely clear the entire context and 
start a fresh. So then I think that's 
enough about context for now and in the 
next lesson we're going to talk about 
tools and permissions.
