Okay, then my friends, in this lesson, 
we're going to talk about something 
called slash commands, which I'm just 
going to call commands from here on out 
because it's much shorter. And we're 
also going to make a custom command as 
well. So then, we've already seen and 
used several built-in commands that 
Claude Code gives to us out of the box. 
And we've done that by typing a slash, 
then whatever the command name was, for 
example, clear to clear the context, or 
initialize 
a claw.md file. Now if you just type 
slash on its own then you're going to 
see a list of all the available commands 
that come with claude code and you can 
key up and down to go through these. So 
we've got add dur to give claude access 
to another working directory which in 
essence it allows multiple repository 
development then from one location which 
could be useful if you have related 
projects like a backend and a front end. 
We've got forward/ aents for managing 
sub aents which we will see later on in 
the course. There's clear and compact 
down here which we've used already. 
There's a model one which if we use 
allows us to choose which model we want 
to use. I've got Sonic 4 selected at the 
moment. And also you can escape these 
screens by just hitting the escape key. 
There's also a permissions one somewhere 
which we can use to add permissions for 
different tools in Claude Code for this 
project. And that adds those permissions 
to the local settings file for you when 
you set them up this way. I normally 
just manually add them myself. But 
anyway, I'm not going to read all these 
different commands now because there's 
way too many and we will be using some 
of them in future lessons. But 
definitely take a look through and have 
a little play around with them. The 
thing I'd like to focus on in this 
lesson is making a custom command which 
we can add to this list. And we would 
make a custom command for common tasks 
we might perform in the project. For 
example, in this project, I might be 
making a lot of UI components. So I 
could make a command for generating 
those components which includes a 
detailed prompt. Any context needed and 
any other specific details I can pass to 
the AI model. Then whenever I need to 
make a new UI component, I can just use 
that custom component command to do it. 
So let's give this a shot. The first 
thing we need to do is make a commands 
folder inside this.claw folder. And if 
you don't see that claw folder already, 
you can go ahead and make that too. Then 
inside the commands folder, we can make 
a new markdown file called whatever we 
want the command to be named. For 
example, I'm going to call it UI- 
component.mmd. 
All right. So now inside this file, we 
can give Claude code whatever 
instructions that we want to make a new 
UI component. So I could tell Claude 
where the file should go, the naming 
convention, any component variants I 
want, how to test the component, etc. 
For now, I'm just going to paste in a 
simple set of instructions which tells 
it to make a new single UI component in 
the components folder and then in the UI 
folder. And I say that the component 
should be a functional component with 
the name in Pascal case. I'm also 
telling it to add the following variants 
and sizes for the component using the 
colors from the theme variables in the 
CSS file. And notice how I'm using the 
at sign to load in another file as 
context here. You can do that in these 
custom uh custom commands. Then I tell 
Claude to make a test file for the 
component as well. And I want it to run 
the test until they all pass. Finally, I 
ask it to add the component to the 
preview page so that we can preview it 
in the browser when we're done and not 
to add it anywhere else in the project 
because sometimes Claude can get giddy 
and it wants to use this new stuff 
everywhere else, too. So, by adding 
this, it's just going to get added to 
the preview page. And all this, by the 
way, is just like a really big prompt. 
When we use a custom command, claude 
code essentially pulls in this markdown 
file and it uses it as a prompt. All 
right, so let me close this file. And we 
also need to restart a new Claude 
session for it to pick up on this new 
tool that we've just created or this new 
command rather we've just created. So 
exit out of the current session, then 
start cla back up again. All right. So 
now if we do forward slash, we should 
see the new command that we just 
created. this one right here, UI 
component. So, I'm going to tap on that 
and then I'm just going to press enter 
to run this command. And notice though, 
nowhere in the command did we say what 
kind of UI component to make. So, it's 
basically just handing the reins over to 
the AI to make whatever component it 
sees fit. 
All right, so we can see that it's 
decided to create a card component. So, 
let's go ahead and let it do this. If 
you wanted it to do something different, 
you could say no and tell clog what to 
do differently. We're just going to 
press yes and don't ask again for make 
the commands in this project. 
Okay. And we're going to allow it to 
make these changes. 
And now it wants to run this bash 
command to test out the component. 
Okay, so it looks like it's all done. 
It's created the card component, the 
test file. It's got five variants, three 
sizes, and all the tests have passed. 
It's added the preview to the preview 
page as well. Let's just check over here 
that everything is added before we 
preview this in the browser ourselves. 
So, if we go to UI, we can see the card 
folder and the card file over here. So, 
this is the component. And again, I 
would normally just go through this 
thoroughly, make sure it is coded how I 
would want it. Same for this file. any 
content that Claude generates, I would 
just have a look through. Then if we go 
to app and then go to preview, we can 
see we've got changes in the page file. 
So somewhere in here, there should be a 
new card component probably right at the 
bottom. So let's scroll all the way 
down. 
It's a big file now, but there we go. We 
can see the different variants of the 
card component. So now let's see what it 
looks like in a browser. All right. 
Right. So, I'm just on the preview page 
and if we scroll right down, we should 
hopefully see these cards. Yeah, we do. 
So, we can see these different 
variations as well. They look pretty 
nice to be honest. So, we've got 
primary, secondary, success, warning 
card, danger, and they've all got a 
little hover effect as well, which I 
quite like. We've got different sizes, 
interactive cards. Wow, that's quite 
nice. Uh, disabled card, uh, feature 
cards with little icons on them. So, 
it's done a pretty extensive job here 
and I could easily see myself using 
these kind of cards in this project. 
Let's just check what they look like in 
dark mode. So, let's click on this. And 
if we scroll right down, yeah, we've got 
dark mode variations as well. Awesome. 
All right. So, that worked and it looked 
okay. But currently, whenever we use 
this command, we're getting a mystery 
component. We don't know what it's going 
to be and we're passing that decision to 
cla code. Instead, when I use this 
command, I'd like to specify exactly 
what UI component that I want. So, for 
example, I would say forward/ UI 
component and then something like card 
with maybe a brief description as well. 
And we can do that using command 
arguments. So, if we open up the command 
file, I'm going to add this little 
section at the top of the file. And 
there's a few things we need to go over. 
First of all, we've got this front 
matter at the top of the file, which is 
a markdown feature that lets us supply a 
kind of metadata for the file. In this 
case, we've got two properties inside 
the front matter. Description, which is 
what the command does, right? And an 
argument hint to tell us what kind of 
arguments are expected when we run this 
command. Now, both of these are going to 
show up in the chat interface when we 
use the tool to remind us of what this 
command does and what it needs. Next up, 
I've added this new context section 
where we instruct Claude code to pass 
this dollar sign arguments variable to 
get some values. Now, this arguments 
thing is how Claude code captures 
whatever arguments we pass into the 
command when we call it. And it doesn't 
matter whether we pass one, two, or five 
arguments. They're all caught within 
this single dollar sign arguments value. 
In our case, I want to be able to pass 
two arguments, a name and a summary of 
the component we're making. So, we 
somehow need to pass those two arguments 
from the arguments value. Now, I've not 
seen any official guidance on how to 
pass multiple values from this on the 
docs or anywhere else, but I found the 
following method works really well. I 
use square brackets to essentially 
create variables with values where the 
name of the variable is the thing in the 
square brackets and the text on the 
right is telling Claude code what to 
store for this. This is actually how we 
make reference links in markdown, but I 
also find it works well for this kind of 
thing. So, we're telling Claude code to 
try and pass the arguments to find and 
store these values, which means we can 
then use them down here in the 
instructions. 
So, I'm now just going to highlight all 
of this task part, delete it, and 
replace it with a new instruction 
incorporating those argument values. And 
I still tell it to make a UI component, 
but this time I tell it to use the name 
and summary values. first for the folder 
and file names, second for the component 
name, and lastly I tell it to reference 
the summary when making the component 
itself. So now when we call this command 
from claude code, we can pass in the 
arguments which then get passed and then 
used by the AI to come up with the 
component using those values. Before we 
do that though, we need to exit Claude 
and restart it again because we made a 
change to the command file. So exit out 
and then fire it back up. 
Okay, then. So now if I press forward 
slash we can see UI component and it 
tells us create a UI component in this 
directory. I'm going to press tab on 
this and you can see it's given us a 
hint for the arguments it expects now. 
So let's make maybe an icon component. 
So it should be called icon. Then I'm 
going to do a pipe to do the second 
argument. And I'll just say an icon 
component for showing icons with a 
circular background. Let's see what it 
does for that. And let's press enter. 
All right, then. So, it's asking to make 
edits. So, I'm going to select the 
second option and press enter. 
Okay, so it looks like it's done 
everything. So let's close this and also 
this and see what files it's created and 
changed. If we take a look inside the UI 
folder, we can see now we've got an icon 
folder. We've got the test file and the 
component itself. So we have the 
variants that we can pass in the size. 
We have the on click. We also have a 
class name as well. They're the icon 
props. Okay, let's have a look around 
here. So, the child I think will be a 
icon itself, I think. Let's have a look 
what it's done inside the preview page. 
Let's scroll right to the bottom where 
the icons are. Yeah, it's added them. 
Okay, so we have these little emojis 
embedded into the icon. So, I guess 
whatever icon we want, we would output 
it here, whether it's an emoji or some 
icon from a package that you might use. 
All right. So, I'm just on the preview 
page again and I'm going to scroll right 
the way down. All right. So, we can see 
these icons right here and they look 
okay. I think instead of using emojis, I 
would probably have used some icon 
package. I would have preferred that. 
And to be honest, that's something I 
would have just gone back and told 
Claude and it could have edited those 
files again and it would have updated it 
to make it work correctly as I see fit. 
And that's the importance of staying in 
the loop, looking what it's doing, and 
not just accepting everything it does by 
default. 
And in fact, I couldn't help myself. 
I've just been back to the code. I've 
asked Cloud Code to change it and use an 
icon library instead. And if we take a 
look at these now, I'm hopeful that 
they're going to look a little bit 
better. If we go right down. Okay, there 
we go. Yeah, that looks loads better. 
We've got all these different variants. 
We've got different sizes, interactive 
icons. We've got action bars, different 
ways we can use them. Yeah, they all 
look loads better. Anyway, I think 
that's enough on commands and custom 
commands. And in the next lesson, we're 
going to look at MCP servers.
