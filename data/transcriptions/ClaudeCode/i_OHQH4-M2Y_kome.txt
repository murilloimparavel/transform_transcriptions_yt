Okay then. So now we've got Claude code 
set up and running inside this project. 
I would like to start using it to make 
some changes to the code and working on 
new components. But before we do that, 
it's always a good idea when you're 
starting to use the forward/init command 
to initialize a claude.md file inside 
the project root. And when we do this, 
claude scans the entire codebase. It 
looks at the folder structure, how we 
start the application, any state 
management we use, etc. the whole Shazam 
so that it gets a good feel for the 
project, where everything goes and how 
it should code new features in the 
future. Then it summarizes all of that 
and it dumps the information into a 
claude.md file in a structured human 
readable format. Then whenever we have 
an active session with claude code to 
either ask about our project code or to 
make changes to the code, it uses that 
claude.md file as context and guidance. 
It's almost like a mini documentation of 
your code for claw to use whenever it's 
trying to figure out the best way to 
implement something or to give feedback. 
So then I'm going to press enter now to 
run this command and see what it comes 
up with. 
And you can see as it's doing this, it's 
created a little to-do list for itself. 
It's going to explore the repository, 
analyze the package.json and the source 
code. It's going to check for exe 
existing documentation files. And then 
finally, it's going to create this 
claw.md file at the bottom. And you can 
see that it's kind of checking things 
off as it does it. So, it's really good 
to see the progress of what it's doing 
in between all that. It's reading the 
files. It's searching for things. So, 
yeah, it's doing a real extensive kind 
of task. 
All right. Then, so now once it's done 
all that, you can see it's created this 
plan. And if we scroll right to the 
bottom, it's asking us, do you want to 
create this claw.md file? And I'm going 
to select yes. So then it goes ahead to 
create that file, which we can see in 
the root of the project directory now. 
So let's open that up over here and see 
what it looks like. So you can see this 
file provides guidance to claude code 
when working with code in this 
repository. So it's got some different 
development commands that it's found 
from the package.json thing right here. 
It's got an architecture overview. So it 
says what it is briefly. It's a Nex.js15 
blog application. You can see the 
different things we're using inside it. 
So React 19, Tailwind, V4, uh, Vest, 
etc. We've got a project structure, 
which is quite nice. So it knows that 
when it's creating new files, hopefully 
where to put those files. Uh, we've got 
some data architecture right here. So it 
knows that we're using Higgraph for the 
content. And down here we've got 
information about the styling. Um, we've 
got a testing setup right here and some 
additional development notes as well. 
So, this is quite comprehensive. It 
gives Cloud Code now a good guide as to 
what we're doing. And whenever we make 
changes, it can use this guide. Now, 
since I'd already started this project 
before Claude Code got involved, it was 
able to scan my existing codebase and 
pick up on a lot of things. So, it could 
make a detailed Claude file based on the 
code I've got. But if you're starting 
with a brand new project with virtually 
no setup files or code, then it's going 
to have much less to work with. And the 
claw.md file is probably not going to 
have much in it. But in that case, you 
can manually go into the file and edit 
it yourself to outline any highlevel 
project structures you're going to put 
in place, any tools, packages, or 
frameworks you're going to be using, 
your code style preferences, and just 
basically an overall summary of the 
application. And you can just update it 
as you go then. And that last bit is 
important whether you're starting with a 
new project or an existing one because 
you should keep this file updated if you 
change your file structure, any packages 
you use, or anything else outlined 
inside this file. If you don't, then 
claude code might not automatically pick 
up on those changes, and it could go off 
in a completely different direction when 
you ask it to do something. Anyway, this 
Claude MD file now gets added to the 
session context automatically so that 
Claude can refer to it when it makes 
changes. And you'll find that keeping an 
up-to-date Claude file like this leads 
to much better code generations. So then 
now that we have this file, let's ask 
Claude code to do something and see if 
it sticks to the guidance. So what I 
would like Claude Co to do for us is 
make a new hook which is going to store 
the user's theme preference based on 
whatever theme they have when they 
toggle that little icon in the top right 
hand corner. Now I noticed that inside 
the clawed file over here, we don't 
reference a hooks folder. So this would 
be a good opportunity to just update 
this file so that Claude code knows 
where to create hooks. So I'm going to 
save this inside the project structure 
bit right here where it says all hooks 
reusable hooks go inside this hooks 
folder. So now if I ask Claude code to 
make a hook hopefully it's going to 
place inside that folder. All right 
then. So you can see we don't actually 
have a hooks folder at the moment but 
hopefully Claude Code will create that 
as well. I'm going to open up the 
terminal and then I'm going to ask it to 
create this new hook. I will say can you 
create a hook to store the users's theme 
preference in 
when they toggle the theme on the site 
and I will say store the value in local 
storage for next time and then I'm also 
going to say don't use the hook anywhere 
yet because claw code has this habit of 
if it creates a new feature, hook, 
component, whatever it might be, it 
wants to use that hook somewhere in your 
project. So, a lot of the time I add 
this at the end to make sure it doesn't 
do that. So, I'm going to press enter. 
The only thing I'm really concerned with 
at the moment is to test whether claude 
code looks at that claw.md file and 
creates the hook in the correct folder. 
Okay, so it looks like it's come up with 
some code. And if we take a look at this 
over here, you can see it wants to place 
it inside the hooks folder. All right. 
So, if we open this up a little bit, 
this is the hook it's created right 
here. And again, I'm not going to 
examine the code too much. I would 
normally, if this was something I was 
working on, I would definitely examine 
the code, but for now, I'm just going to 
say yes. I'm going to accept that 
change. And you can see it's created the 
hooks folder and it's created the use 
theme file within the folder. Awesome. 
You can also add a memory to the claw. 
MD file directly from the chat session 
by using a hash symbol. For example, I 
could add a hash then say something like 
when making new page components, always 
add a link to that page in the header. 
And you can see down here as I type that 
it's telling us it's going to memorize 
what we're telling it because we added 
that hash. And the long and short of 
that is that it's going to place this 
instruction inside the claw.md file for 
future reference. So that now whenever 
it creates a page component, it should 
hopefully create a header link for it 
too. Now when we hit enter, we're going 
to see a few options. We can save it to 
project memory which is into the 
claude.md file we just created for this 
project. You could save it to local 
project memory in the same root folder 
but with the local part added to the 
file name. And you can also save it to 
global memory which is to a global 
claude file stored in the root claude 
folder on your computer which the 
installation added for us. So project 
memory is what gets set up when we run 
the forward/init command to create this 
claw.nd file in the root of the project. 
And this file is meant to be tracked by 
version control and pushed to your 
remote repository so that any other 
developers working on the project have 
the same clawed file with the same 
guidance for clawed code for this 
project. And that means any memories or 
information in this file should be 
specific to the project. For example, 
folder structure, naming conventions, 
tests, frameworks, etc. The local 
project memory is a file meant for your 
own personal guidance and preferences 
when it comes to working with claude 
code. So, for example, outlining any 
kind of personal tooling you might use 
that isn't necessarily something other 
developers working on the same project 
would use. And this file wouldn't be 
pushed to the remote repository and it 
would just be local to you inside this 
project. And finally, user memory is 
your personal guidance to Claude when it 
comes to all projects you work on. So 
any tools you use globally across many 
projects or any personal code style 
preferences that you have would go in 
that file. And again, this would just be 
for you on your computer, but it would 
be for every project that Claude Code 
runs in. For now, we're just going to 
add this to the project memory, meaning 
it should get added to the claude.md 
file that we already have. So, if I 
close this off and open this file up, we 
should be able to see at the bottom that 
new memory has been added. And you can 
see right here, when making new page 
components, always add a link to that 
page in the header. Awesome. All right. 
So, now we're going to test this out. 
So, I'm going to open code backup, and 
I'm going to paste in a prompt, which 
says, can you add a new about page with 
only an H2 title and a single line of 
Lauram as contact uh content rather? So, 
press enter. Hopefully, it's going to 
read that instruction in the claw. MD 
file as well and create a link for us. 
And you can see in its to-dos, it says 
right here, add about page link to the 
header navigation. So, it knows about 
that. All right. So, I'm just going to 
accept these changes. Again, normally 
you should check this, but for the sake 
of this tutorial, I'm just going to 
accept this. And again, it's asking for 
permission to edit the file, the layout 
file this time to add a new link. Again, 
I'm going to press yes. You can do this. 
And then another change to the layout 
file, which I'm going to accept as well. 
Okay. And now it's done. So if I close 
this off, open up app and then we can 
see this about page and inside there we 
have an H2 title and just a single line 
of Lauram Ipsum. Awesome. And then if we 
go to the layout page which it's edited. 
Hopefully it's added a link right here. 
So it's added it to this nav. So it says 
about right here. Now let's try this out 
in a browser. Okay. So yes, it has done 
that. You can see the about link here. 
And if we click on that, we go to the 
about page. Now you can see also 
retrospectively it's added these other 
two links which I didn't ask it to do. 
And this is one of the things I've 
noticed about clawed code. Sometimes 
like I mentioned before it sometimes 
likes to do things beyond the scope of 
what you've asked it to do. So it is 
important to maybe tell claw code look 
don't do this just do this. And that 
could be something you add to your 
claude.md file. Now just really quickly 
I do want to mention that on the Claude 
code docs they say that the local memory 
is being deprecated in favor of 
importing unttracked files within the 
project level memory to provide that 
personal context to Claude. And I'll 
show you how to import and reference 
files later in the course. But at the 
time of recording this video the local 
option still shows in the terminal when 
you use the memory hashtag shortcut to 
add new memories. Another way you can 
access your memory files is by using the 
memory command which is just forward 
slashmemory. And by the way, if it isn't 
already obvious, when I say memory 
files, I'm just talking about the 
claw.md files, whether they're project 
local or global. But anyway, when you 
use this memory command, claude code's 
going to ask you which memory file you 
want to open and edit. So you can select 
any of these and press enter to open 
that file up. For example, if I select 
the project memory, it's going to open 
up the claw.md file right here in VS 
Code so that I can edit it directly 
myself. So then just to summarize, it's 
always good practice to use the 
forward/init command when you bring 
claud code into a project because it 
gives Claude the chance to learn about 
the codebase and outline any structural 
patterns, frameworks, libraries, naming 
conventions, etc. in a claude file. That 
file is then used by Claude as context 
automatically when it makes decisions 
about your project in the future and it 
can be added to your remote repository 
so that other developers working on the 
project have access to it as well for 
their own workflow using clawed code. 
Finally, it's not something you should 
just create and then forget about, but 
rather keep on top of edit and update 
when things change within your project. 
That way, you're always keeping Claude 
in the loop, and you'll find its work to 
be much more in line with your project's 
existing current code and structure.
