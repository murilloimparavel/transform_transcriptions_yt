All 
right then, gang. In this lesson, I want 
to talk about something called MCP and 
MCP servers, which can give Claude code 
the ability to connect and communicate 
with external data sources, services, 
and APIs. For example, when I'm working 
with Claude in this project right now, 
it knows about my project, and it can 
use all its built-in tools to make 
changes and run bash commands and 
whatnot. But those tools only extend to 
the scope of this codebase, right? And 
there's no tools for claude code to 
interact with external data sources, 
third party services or APIs. I can't 
tell it for example to reach out to a 
database to analyze my tables or even 
create a new one for me because it 
doesn't have the tools to do that. But 
that's where MCP servers come into play. 
So just very briefly, MCP stands for 
model context protocol. It was designed 
by Anthropic who made claude code and it 
defines a way that AI models can 
interact with external sources. And we 
do this by providing them with 
additional tools and context through MCP 
servers. And different MCP servers come 
with different tools to do different 
things and interact with different 
sources. So you can think of an MCP 
server as something you can essentially 
plug into Claude code or whatever client 
you're using and then Claude directed by 
the AI model can use whatever tools the 
server provides to interact with some 
external data source. For example, the 
Superbase MCP server contains tools to 
do things like list tables, deploy edge 
functions, and even execute SQL 
commands. So, if I installed the 
Superbase MCP server, Claude would have 
access to all those tools. And I could 
say to Claude code, read the blogs table 
in Superbase, make an interface to model 
the records. And in response, Claude 
would check for any tools it can use to 
do this. And it would find one in this 
Superbase MCP server. It would then use 
that tool which is just a function 
defined within the server to reach out 
to the database and find the blogs 
table. It would read it and then return 
the format of that table to claude code 
and then using that data claude code 
could decide how to make the interface. 
So when we use MCP servers, it's not the 
AI itself or the client like Claude code 
that reaches out directly to these 
external sources. It's the MCP server 
that does that and then it provides 
claude code or whatever client you might 
be using with the ability to call and 
use those tools. Another MCP server 
called Playright provides AI models with 
the tools to open a browser, navigate 
through web pages, inspect elements, 
take screenshots. The context 7 MCP 
server provides tools to get up-to-date 
documentation from a lot of frameworks 
and libraries which you can then ask 
Claude code to use when implementing new 
features using those frameworks or 
libraries. And there's loads more too 
which you can find on websites like this 
one, pulsemcp.com. 
So definitely check that out. We're 
going to install these two servers right 
here, context 7 and playright. And over 
the next couple of lessons, we're going 
to put them to use in our workflow. 
First though, how do we actually add the 
servers? Well, if we take a look at the 
claude code docs on the MCP installation 
section, you can see that we can add 
them locally on our computer or by 
connecting to them remotely. Now we'll 
be adding the servers locally. So we'll 
be using this option at the top. And the 
way we do this is by using the command 
claude mcp add and then whatever the 
server name is then the command and any 
arguments. Also if you're on Windows 
then you're currently you'll need to add 
one more thing which if we scroll down 
here you're going to see in a big yellow 
warning box and that is to add cmd and 
then forward slash c. So the cmd part 
opens the windows command line to run 
the command. The forward/ C part makes 
sure the shell gets closed after it's 
been run. Now, normally when we use an 
MCP server, the server docs gives us the 
whole string to copy and paste in a 
terminal, which is then going to add the 
server. But just be aware that you might 
need to add the cmd/ cart if you're on 
Windows for servers that use npx. 
Otherwise, it might not work correctly. 
Anyway, let's head back to the context 7 
MCP page and we're going to see what it 
says there about the installation. So, 
if we click on this MCP link up at the 
top, it should take us to the GitHub 
page for the server, which it does. And 
then, if you scroll right down, we 
should eventually see a bunch of options 
for adding the server to different 
clients. One of those options should be 
Clawed Code. So, click on that to expand 
it. And we're going to get a few 
different options. The first two are for 
remote server connections. The one at 
the bottom is for a local connection. So 
we say claude mcp add. Then the server 
name which is context 7. Then we have 
this double dash. Then the npx command. 
So we're going to copy this now and 
paste it into the terminal. And then 
we're also going to make a few edits. So 
then I've pasted this into my terminal 
already and I'm just going to add 
another few things in. The first thing 
we'll do is we're going to add another 
flag to this just before the double dash 
and that is the scope flag. So when we 
add MCP servers with claude code, we can 
add them to three different scopes. 
Project scope where the MCP setup gets 
pushed to remotes and everyone working 
on the project can use the MCPs added to 
the project. Local scope which is where 
only you can use the MCP server on this 
particular project and global scope 
which is when the MCP is added globally 
to claude code and you can use it for 
any project on your computer. Now the 
default scope is local but I want to 
make it a project scope so that we can 
see the MCP configuration here in the 
project directory and mostly I use 
either project or global scope. I very 
rarely use local scope. Anyway to add 
this scope we use the scope flag 
followed by project to specify project 
scope. And again this could also be 
local or global. Now before we go any 
further I will say this. If you're 
running Claude Code natively on Windows, 
it can be a little bit buggy when you're 
adding MCP servers, at least at the time 
of recording this video. If you're on a 
Mac, then you probably won't have to 
jump through any hoops or workarounds, 
and you can just hit enter right now, 
and this would work. If you're on 
Windows, though, you have to do a few 
more things for it to work properly. 
First, we have to add the cmd and then 
forward/ C bit just before the rest of 
this npx command like we talked about 
earlier. Secondly, if we run this right 
now, we're going to get an error, which 
I'll show you by hitting enter. And that 
error says there's an unknown option Y, 
which comes right after the npx bit. 
Now, the Y flag is for auto accepting 
defaults to prompts when some package is 
installed, and it needs to be there in 
this case. So, how do we get around 
this? Well, one solution is to run the 
whole thing without the Y flag first, 
which we'll do now. And when we do that, 
it's going to work. and claude code 
makes this MCP.json file in the root of 
the project. Now if we take a look at 
that, we'll see this JSON object with an 
MCP servers property inside. And it's 
within this property that all project 
level servers get added. So we can see 
this context 7 one right here that we 
just added. And inside that the servers 
configured with these different 
properties. The type is standard in out 
since this is a local MCP connection 
that we added. The command is cmd and 
that's because on Windows we added that 
extra cmd part. Then we have some 
arguments including the forward sl bit 
which we also added because we're on 
Windows. Now again if you're on a Mac 
this will probably look a little bit 
different and you won't need to make any 
changes. But on Windows because we 
removed that hyphen y flag we should now 
manually add this in to the arguments 
array after the npx one. So let's do 
that now and then save the file. Right 
then. So hopefully now that's all going 
to work when we start up Claude Code. 
But I do think this whole workound when 
using Windows is a little bit clunky and 
I'm hoping that it's something that can 
be made simpler in the future and maybe 
when you're watching this video it will 
be. Anyway, now let's try using this. 
Now when I've just tried using this MCP 
server, I got some kind of connection 
error. It failed. It didn't work for 
whatever reason. So I'm actually going 
to use the remote server from Context 7. 
It's strange because when I tried this 
out before recording, it did work. 
everything was fine. Uh, but this is the 
problem sometimes because Claude Code is 
new, MCP servers are new, they're 
changing a lot. Sometimes things can 
just not work and it might take a little 
while for things to level out. So, what 
I'm going to do now is go back to the 
docs and look for the other command I 
need to run for a remote server. So, 
we're going to go ahead with this one 
right here, which uses HTTP as the 
transport system. So, let's copy this. 
All right. All right. So, I've pasted 
that into my terminal. But I'm going to 
add one more thing and that is the scope 
flag after the server name. So, after 
context 7, do double dash then scope and 
then project to add this at a project 
level. Press enter. Hopefully, now it's 
going to add that server for us. And if 
we close this terminal and take a look 
over here, we should see the mcp.json 
file. And yeah, we see that context 7 
property inside. This time the type is 
HTTP because we're using a remote 
connection. And this is the URL for the 
server as well. Cool. So now we need to 
start Claude backup, which I'm going to 
do over here by typing claude and then 
press enter. Let's get rid of the file 
tree. And then inside here, I'm going to 
say forward/mcp. 
And this time hopefully we will see the 
concept 7. Okay, it failed to connect. 
What I'm going to do is press enter and 
then I'm going to reconnect to this to 
see if it does connect this time. Okay, 
looks like it's worked. So forward/mcp. 
Now we can see a green tick next to 
that. We're connected to context 7 and 
we can start using it. So let me escape 
out of that. Okay. So now I'm going to 
get Claude code to use context 7 by 
typing in this prompt and it says, can 
you check the latest Tailwind docs to 
see if the theme variables are correctly 
configured in the global CSS file. Use 
context 7. I'm also going to reference 
that CSS file so it knows where to look. 
So that's source app and then 
globals.css. 
And then I'm going to press enter. But 
before I do that, notice I said use 
context 7. That's so it explicitly knows 
to use the MCP server to get the 
up-to-ate information. So let me press 
enter to do this. And now it wants to 
use this resolve library ID tool from 
context 7. And then it wants to use an 
additional tool and it wants my 
permission to do this. So I'm going to 
press yes right here. And now you can 
see right here it says looking at your 
Tailwind CSS configuration. your theme 
variables are correctly configured blahy 
blahy blah it's properly structured okay 
so everything is as it should be awesome 
so one thing I like to do with context 7 
is tell claude code to use it whenever 
it needs to implement some feature using 
a third party framework or library 
because a lot of the time it can use 
legacy code so I want to make sure that 
it uses the up-to-date documentation 
every time that it creates some code 
using those frameworks and that's not 
just clawed code by the way that's any 
AI tool tool or model, they can all use 
legacy code because they're trained on 
that legacy code. So, what I'm going to 
do is add a memory using the hash over 
here. So, if I press hash, we're going 
to add a memory and then I'm going to 
paste in this memory that says use 
context 7 to check up toate docs when 
needed for implementing new libraries or 
frameworks or adding features using 
them. So, if I press enter, we're going 
to add that to the project memory. And 
if we then open this file up, we should 
see that at the bottom now. Yep, there 
it is. Awesome. 
Okay then. So now we're going to add 
another server called Playright which 
provides Claude Code with the tools to 
do things like open a browser, click on 
links, take screenshots, etc. So I'm on 
the Playright MCP page right here. And 
for Claude Code, it says run this 
command, which because we're on Windows, 
we're going to have to tweak again. I 
also want to make sure we're using 
project scope when we add it. So copy 
this command, then head back to your 
terminal. So then I've already added 
this command in as well as two other 
things. the scope flag first of all over 
here to say we want to add this at 
project level and then also the cmd 
slash cart because we're running this on 
Windows this time we don't need to add 
the y flag for this particular server 
all right so now let's hit enter 
hopefully that's going to add the 
playright server to the mcpjson file so 
let's take a look at that over here and 
yeah we can see we've got the context 7 
one now and also the playright one and 
this time the type is standard in out 
the command cmd then the arguments down 
here. Awesome. So then now we need to 
start cla back up again so that we can 
try using this. Okay, so I've started 
clawed up and the first thing I'm going 
to do is use the MCP tool to make sure 
that they're connected correctly. Yep. 
Okay, cool. And now I'm going to escape 
and I'm just going to ask Claude Code to 
maybe open a browser and navigate to 
netinja.dev 
dev and give me a summary of the site. 
So this is just to show you that it can 
navigate to a site using playright or 
playright can on its behalf and provide 
feedback that we need. So it's going to 
ask for permission first of all. So 
we'll say yes. And then on my other 
screen it's opened up netinja.dev which 
we can see right here. So it's just 
going to do its browsing. I'm going to 
take that back off screen. All right. So 
now it's come back with a little bit of 
information. It says, "Net Ninja is a 
comprehensive coding education platform 
created by Sha focused on web 
development training. The site positions 
itself as a coding dojo where aspiring 
developers become coding ninjas. So I'm 
quite pleased with that. It gives us 
this other information about it as well 
which is quite extensive to be honest. 
But Playright can do more than just 
this. And what I'd like to do is use 
Playright to give us feedback on the UX 
of components that we make when it views 
them in the browser. So, in the next 
lesson, what we're going to be doing is 
making our own sub agent with claw code, 
and we're going to be using the 
playright MCP from within that sub agent 
to do just
