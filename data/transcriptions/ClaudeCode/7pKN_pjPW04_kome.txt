All right then gang. So I want to move 
away from prompting context commands and 
sub aents now and move on to another 
nice feature in Claude Code which is the 
Claude Code GitHub app. And this is 
something we can set up easily from 
within the Claude Code chat session. And 
I'm going to show you how to do that in 
a moment. But basically when we install 
it, it creates two GitHub actions for us 
automatically which are both really 
useful. The first one is that it can 
autoreview pull requests and provide 
feedback on those pull requests. The 
second one allows Claude code to 
automatically work on issues on a new 
feature branch when you mention at 
Claude inside it. Now before I show you 
how to set up this feature, I will say 
that you need to have the GitHub CLI 
already installed on your computer, 
which you can do by following these 
installation instructions. So I'm going 
to leave a link to this repo down below 
the video, but essentially you can just 
install it via something like Homebrew 
on a Mac or Winger on Windows. It's all 
really simple to do and it outlines the 
steps in this readme file. Once you've 
installed the GitHub CLI, you'll also 
need to login by running this command in 
your terminal. ghorth orth login. Once 
you've done that, you're ready to set up 
the claude code GitHub app. All right, 
so inside claude code, we can use a 
built-in slash command, which is 
slashinstall 
github app. And I'm going to press enter 
here. And what that does is set up the 
GitHub actions for the repository that 
we want to give it access to. So, I'm 
going to press enter. And then it's 
going to ask us which repository we want 
to use. We can enter a different one if 
we want, but I'm going to use the one 
linked up to this local repo right here 
that I'm in. So, I'm going to press 
enter on this option. Then, it's going 
to open a browser and it's going to ask 
us to install Claude Code on GitHub. So, 
let's click the install button over 
here. We need to authorize it. Now, you 
can choose to allow it access to all 
repositories or only select 
repositories. I'm just going to select 
this one to give it access to the Claude 
code tutorial one, which is this down 
here. And then I'm going to install and 
authorize this. And then once you've 
authenticated it and installed it on 
your GitHub account, you can just come 
back to the terminal and press enter to 
complete this. And it says select GitHub 
workflows to install. We're going to 
install both of them. I'm just going to 
press enter. And then we're just going 
to choose the first option here. Create 
a long live token with your Claw 
subscription. It's going to ask you to 
authorize with your Claude Code account. 
So, I'm going to do that. Once you've 
authenticated with Anthropic, it's going 
to ask you to create this pull request. 
And this is basically two actions that 
it's created. It explains everything 
down here. We can just create this pull 
request. 
And then one of the actions is to 
automatically review pull requests. And 
down here, we're just waiting for some 
checks to be completed. Once they've 
completed, you can merge that request. 
And now up here, if we go to actions, we 
should be able to see we've got these 
two actions right here, Claude Code and 
Claude Code review. Okay, so now we're 
ready to put Cloud Code to use in the 
GitHub repository. And I'm going to 
create an issue in a second. And the 
issue is going to be that this title up 
here doesn't link to anywhere. And 
ideally, it should link to this page, 
the homepage. So let's create an issue 
and tell Claude Code to handle this. All 
right, then. So let's head to issues. 
And we're going to create a new issue. 
We'll just say link from title missing. 
And then I'll say there is no link from 
the title in navbar 
to the homepage. 
All right. So I'm going to create this 
issue. Now nothing happens 
automatically. But if I come down here 
and mention Claude, I can just say at 
Claude and I'll say, "Can you fix this? 
I'm going to comment over here." And 
hopefully just after a minute or so, 
Claude is going to start work on this 
task. 
And you can see now Claude has picked it 
up and it's starting to work on this 
issue. 
All right. So, it's created this little 
to-do list much like it does in Claude 
code within the terminal and it's 
looking at the different things it needs 
to do. examining the current navbar, 
adding the link for the title. It's 
going to test it. Then it's going to 
commit and push the changes. Then it's 
also going to provide a PR creation link 
which we can go and take a look at. All 
right. So, it's finished its little 
to-do list now. And there's a summary 
down here to say that it's fixed it and 
any changes that have been made. It's 
also created the PR or rather it gives 
us a link to create the PR based on this 
edit. So if we go there, it's 
prepopulated this description and also 
the title for the PR. I'm going to 
create this pull request. And when we 
create a pull request, Claude Code 
automatically picks up on the pull 
request and provides us with a code 
review. And you can see now down here, 
the Claude Code review is going in the 
background. Okay, so now it's finished 
its review and we can see the feedback 
down here. We get a big green tick, 
which means it's pretty good overall. 
So, we get a tick for code quality, a 
tick for bugs, a tick for performance 
and security. Overall, it says approve. 
Yep. All right. So, let's go down here. 
We can merge the pull request now and 
confirm the merge. 
Okay. So, I just pulled down those 
changes so we could preview this in a 
browser. And now, if we hover over this 
title, you can see it goes purple. We 
get the little pointer icon. And if we 
click on it, it goes to the homepage. 
Awesome. So, that's now working. So then 
that's how claude code can work directly 
in your central GitHub repository and I 
think it's quite a nice addition to the 
product. You can also make additional 
actions by the way to include claude 
code in different ways and different 
workflows. So it's definitely worth 
looking through the action files and 
playing around with them.
