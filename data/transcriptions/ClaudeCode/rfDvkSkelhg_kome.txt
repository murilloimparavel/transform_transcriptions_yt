There's a new king of AI coding
tools and its name is Claude Code. 
But six months ago, I was
using Claude code all wrong. 
I was basically treating it like ChatGPT
with a save button, typing in vague 
prompts and just hoping for the best. 
It was like buying a Ferrari, but
never taking it out of first gear. 
Fast forward to today and
I'm a Claude Code power user. 
I can run multiple instances of Claude
Code at the same time and work on a week's 
worth of features in just a few hours. 
See how each Claude Code instance
is working on different app feature 
completely independent from the other. 
And yes, Claude Code will merge all
the changes together at the end. 
In this video, I'm gonna save
you six months of pain by sharing 
36 specific lessons about how to
get the most out of Claude Code. 
These lessons are gonna be
organized into three clear levels 
beginner, intermediate, and master. 
In level one, the beginner section we're
gonna cover Claude code foundations. 
We'll cover installation and setup
essential concepts and commands and how 
to use things like the Claude.md file
to put you ahead of 99% of beginners. 
In level two, the intermediate section,
we're gonna look at workflow enhancements. 
We'll cover Claude's planning mode using
Claude for research and documentation, 
and using Claude Code to automatically
answer issues and create prs in GitHub. 
And finally, level three,
the master section. 
We're gonna look at advanced techniques. 
We'll cover things like using multiple
Claude codes at the same time to 
work on multiple different features. 
Custom commands and custom sub-agent
and using Claude Code with MCP servers. 
So whether you're a Claude Code
beginner or power user like me, I 
can guarantee that you're gonna learn
something from this video that's gonna 
help you cook at a higher level with 
But before we dive in, I'm Avthar and
I teach people how to use AI coding 
tools, even if you're new to coding. 
So if you're trying to level up
with AI coding tools, maybe it's 
for your job, maybe it's for a new
business you're trying to start. 
Maybe it's for a side project. 
Please subscribe to the channel and
turn on notifications for more videos 
about the best AI coding tools and
how to get the most out of them. 
With that out the way, let's get into
level one the foundations of Claude Code. 
alright, so if you're new to Claude
Code or feel like you might be missing 
some basics, this section is for you. 
We're gonna cover everything you need
to get up and running with Claude Code, 
including things like installation
and setup, basic commands, project 
configurations, and debugging. 
First up, installation. 
The way that you install Claude Code
and the way that the majority of 
people use it is just on their local
laptops or their local machines. 
You go to the Anthropic website, copy the
command for Claude Code, and install it 
on your local machine using your terminal. 
It's quick, it's easy. 
And you can begin coding right away. 
Option two, and this is great for using
Claude Code for backend projects, is to 
install Claude Code on a remote server. 
Just log into wherever the survey is
hosted, for example, AWS Digital Ocean or 
Hertzner and install Claude Code just like
you would, things like Python or Node. 
A bonus of the remote server
approach is that this allows 
you to code from anywhere. 
For example. 
You can use the Termius App on iOS to
control Claude Code right from your phone. 
Tip number three is that you
can use Claude Code inside other 
AI coding tools like cursor,
windsurf, and IDEs like VS code. 
This is great if you're already
familiar with those tools or still 
getting comfortable with the terminal. 
To get started. 
Navigate to the directory of your
choice and type Claude in your terminal. 
You can also use the resume
flag that's dash dash resume to 
continue any previous session. 
Tip number four is to use my
favorite feature of Claude 
Code, and that's to-do lists. 
This is the thing that made Claude
Code stand out for me among all the 
other AI coding tools at the time, 
it didn't just jump into
writing code straight away. 
First it created a to-do list. 
Now this happens most of the time
automatically, but you can also 
explicitly prompt Claude Code to use
to-do list in the prompt that you give it. 
The great thing about to-do lists
is that as Claude works, it checks 
off items so that you can see what's
happening and what's coming next. 
And it also enables Claude to work
on big, complex tasks without getting 
stuck in loops or erasing past work 
Next, let's look at
some essential commands. 
First up is bash mode. 
Bash mode enables you to run
bash commands inside Claude Code. 
So you don't have to exit out of it. 
Claude can also run bash commands
itself, meaning it can do things 
like read and write files, search
and even handle git commands for you. 
For example, you can tell Claude to read
all the files in a certain folder and 
use it for context for tasks it will do. 
Tip number six is to use Claude
for instant documentation. 
Documentation doesn't have to be painful. 
Just ask Claude to explore and explain
the architecture of an app and how it 
works and save its output in a file
called something like architecture.md. 
This is great when you're getting up
to speed with a new project or touching 
a project that you haven't worked on
in a couple weeks, or just documenting 
key things for you, your teammates,
or even Claude to reference later. 
Tip number eight is auto accept mode. 
Claude will usually prompt you
for permissions to make changes. 
If you wanna let Claude take the
wheel, you can turn on auto accept mode 
by pressing shift and tab together. 
This enables Claude to make
changes without asking each time. 
Tip number nine is about model switching. 
Now, Claude Code allows you to choose
from a variety of anthropic models 
to power its AI coding sessions. 
The slash model command allows
you to choose which model to use. 
You can use Opus, which is the most
powerful model when you need deeper 
analysis or want the most powerful coding
capabilities for your toughest challenges. 
And you can use sonnet for routine tasks. 
So if you just wanna save tokens or
get faster responses I usually keep 
it at the default mode, which is
using Opus until you've hit 50% of 
your usage limits for that month. 
But my new favorite is actually the opus
plan mode, which is where it uses opus 
the more powerful model to plan and sonnet
The more cost efficient model to actually 
write the code and do the execution. 
It's something I recommend you
play around with and see which 
model works best for your use case. 
Next up, don't be afraid to interrupt. 
Claude. 
The escape key is your friend. 
You can press the escape
key once to interrupt. 
Claude. 
And twice to go back to a
previous prompt in your session. 
Don't hesitate to interrupt, Claude,
if you see it heading in the wrong 
direction, it's much better to redirect
early than to waste precious tokens. 
next up in the beginner section,
let's talk about fixing your mistakes 
or debugging with Claude Code. 
It's actually much simpler than you think. 
First up is a screenshot method. 
Now Claude Code can take images as input,
so if you run into any UI issues or 
any bugs in your application, you can
actually take screenshots and give them 
to Claude Code as inputs for your prompts. 
This allows Claude to see all the
context and it usually can tell 
exactly what went wrong or it allows
you to pinpoint exactly where in the 
UI you want to make a particular fix. 
Now you can also use the image
input for other things like giving 
it UI designs and diagrams as well. 
But I think the most common
usage is for debugging. 
The next level of debugging is letting
Claude write your test for you. 
This is as simple as just asking Claude
to write tests for a particular feature or 
write tests for the new onboarding flow. 
Just make sure to focus on general
end-to-end tests rather than 
implementation specific ones. 
And we can take this further with tip
number 13, which is using Claude Code 
for test driven development, or TDD. 
Now, test driven development is a
really popular software engineering 
philosophy, but when it comes to Claude
Code, essentially what this means is 
asking Claude to first write tests for a
given feature and then to implement it. 
This helps Claude catch issues early and
it gives it a bit of structure to work 
with, which can lead to better outputs. 
Next up is project configuration, and
that brings us to what I think is the 
most important thing in this video. 
Which is the claude.md file. 
You can think of the claude.md
file as your project's memory. 
It's a file that gets added to context
every single time Claude Code does 
any task, and it's all the information
that you wanna give Claude Code 
to work on your project your way. 
Here's some snippets of myClaude.md
file for an iOS app that I'm working on. 
It consists of things like git workflows
and best practices, project and 
architecture overviews, build commands and
best practices for things like testing and 
debugging and analytics and documentation. 
How-tos. 
Now the great thing about putting these
in the Claude.md file is that Claude 
will follow these rules automatically. 
It'll create proper branches,
commit regularly and never 
accidentally push to main. 
It'll follow my preferences
for documenting its work, and 
always add tests and analytics
when building out new features. 
This ability to follow complex rules
and tailor both workflows and output has 
made Claude my favorite AI coding tool,
outshining the likes of cursor and Replit. 
Now before you worry that you have
to manually write your claude.md 
file, you can actually just
ask Claude to write it for you. 
That's gonna be a recurring theme
in this video using Claude Code to 
help you use Claude Code better. 
What this means in this case is asking
Claude to update the Claude.md file 
as you add specific features to your
project or as you discover preferences 
that you wanna make Claude respect, 
tip number 15 is the message queue. 
Now, the message queue is a real game
changer because it means that you don't 
have to wait for Claude to finish its
current task before you give it input. 
You can just type a message while Claude
is working and it gets added to the 
message queue, and Claude will act on it. 
Once it's finished with the
current task, just add tasks as 
you think of them, and Claude will
work through them all in order. 
And that brings us to tip number 16,
which is the final tip in our beginner 
section, and that is for long prompts. 
You can actually put your prompt
in a markdown file and feed it to 
Claude by referencing that file. 
In the prompt using the at symbol. 
This is much cleaner than trying
to type everything in the terminal. 
And it's great if you have long
prompts, if you wanna think things 
through before you give it to Claude 
now that brings us to the end of the
foundation section that gives you 
everything you need in order to get
started With Claude Code, let's take 
it up a notch to the intermediate
section where we're gonna look at 
Claude Code workflow enhancements. 
Now that you're comfortable with the
basics, it's time for level two or 
the intermediate section, and that's
about working smarter, not harder. 
I'm gonna share with you the enhanced
workflows that I use in Claude Code to 
plan better research faster, and integrate
with my existing GitHub workflows. 
First up is planning and thinking
features that are gonna help you 
level up and enable Claude Code
to tackle your toughest problems. 
Tip number 17 is to use planning mode. 
Now, most of the time you don't just
want to jump straight into writing code. 
Oftentimes you wanna plan and strategize
before you start implementing. 
To do this, use the planning mode on
Claude Code and ask it to plan before 
it starts working on a new feature. 
Just hit tab and shift until
you see the plan only mode. 
And that will ensure that Claude
gives you a plan to review 
before any code is written. 
I use the planning mode all the time
for architecture decisions or to force 
Claude to think through how to fix
narly bugs before it takes action. 
When it comes to planning,
a hidden setting to make use 
of is the opus plan mode. 
This means that you can use opus for
planning and sonnet for implementation 
just by selecting the slash model command. 
This is a good default to ensure that you
get the most powerful model for planning, 
but the cheaper model for implementation. 
Another underrated feature when it
comes to planning is to use subagents 
to create multiple plans for how to do,
let's say, implementing a given feature 
or to fix a certain bug and let you or
Claude, pick the best One Look out for 
more on planning and parallel subagents
in the advanced section of the video. 
Next up. 
Did you know that you can control how
much Claude thinks when it's working? 
Meet the think key words. 
These allow you to tell Claude how
much time to spend thinking when 
you're working on tough problems. 
There's actually three think keywords. 
There's the basic think there's
think hard for deeper analysis 
and for maximum thinking power,
use the keyword ultra think. 
Just include the appropriate
thinking keyword in your prompt. 
And it will tell Claude to use
more of its thinking budget. 
Now, imagine you're prompting Claude
to add a new feature and you're using 
the think hard keyword in your prompt. 
But you're also using planning mode
and you're saving that output into a 
markdown file for future reference. 
That's just one example of combining
tips that we've seen in this video into 
a powerful workflow for vibe coding. 
The next unlock for me was that I could
use Claude Code for more than just code. 
My favorite example of this is research. 
Claude has a web search and web fetch tool
that enables it to search the web and read 
website content and take action on it. 
This means that you can use
Claude Code to research small 
things like how to use a stripe. 
API. 
Or ask it to do larger research tasks,
like put together a report on the best 
or tool to use in your application that
also has pre-built login components. 
It's that powerful. 
This saves you a ton of time and allows
you to take into account more of your apps 
context as you add tools and features. 
Another hidden feature when it comes
to research is that code can read PDFs. 
This means that it can combine
information that you have in PDF files. 
With information that it
finds in its web searches. 
My favorite example of how to use this
feature is feeding Claude PDFs of ChatGPT 
Deep Research reports so that it can
reference those in its research phase. 
Beyond research. 
Claude Code is great
for document generation. 
This is important because I've
noticed that you need to think 
like a product manager and give
Claude code all the context that it 
needs in order to do its job Well. 
The good news is that you don't
have to write all of these 
product specs by yourself. 
You can actually leverage Claude
to generate artifacts that both 
you and Claude reference later. 
I use Claude to generate things like
product requirement docs or PRDs For 
features, user experience guides API,
documentation and technical design docs. 
I find these docs to be more useful than
the ones made in ChatGPT because they take 
into account more of the actual structure
of my application and leverage all the 
context of my project for better results. 
Tip number 26 is something that I
use to stay organized in the projects 
that I build, and that's using Claude
Code for automatic change tracking. 
This is about leveraging Claude Code
for things like creating change logs for 
it to reference later, documenting the
most UpToDate features of your app for 
use on your website, or making things
like decision docs, which outlines 
why you made a particular decision. 
I highly recommend leveraging
Claude Code for keeping track of 
how your project evolves over time,
your future self and your future. 
Claude Code agents will, thank you. 
Next up is a Claude
Code GitHub integration. 
Claude code is fantastic for teams. 
Thanks to its deep integration
with GitHub actions. 
Now you may remember how you can use
Claude Code to handle Git commands 
for you as you develop features, but
this Claude Code and GitHub actions 
integration takes it to the next level. 
First. 
Run the slash install GH actions
from the Claude Code menu. 
And once you've set that up, you
can tag Claude Code in issues and 
pull requests and ask it to fix it. 
And Claude code will run
using GitHub actions. 
And submit a PR or a fix
without needing to run on your 
local or your remote machine. 
Claude can even review PRS
automatically as they come in. 
Finally, in this intermediate
section, I wanna talk about the 
mindset that helps me get the most
out of working with Claude Code 
For best results with working
with Claude Code, you need to 
think like a product manager, and
this means two specific things. 
Firstly, it means giving Claude lots of
clear, relevant context and constraints 
when it comes to achieving your goals. 
Secondly, and probably most importantly,
it means letting go of reviewing the 
code yourself or needing to understand
everything that Claude has implemented 
and working to verify Claude's outputs
at higher levels of abstraction. 
What this means is that you don't
need to understand every line 
of code outputted by Claude. 
Can you verify that the app
experience is what you want? 
Can you verify that the test pass? 
Can you verify that the
app works as intended? 
That's what matters. 
This approach literally changed how I
build with AI coding tools, and it's a 
mindset shift that I had to make similar
to what I've experienced in real life. 
When I had to work and manage
smart, technical people on my team 
at previous jobs that I've held. 
Now this brings us to the end
of level two, the end of the 
intermediate section of Claude Code. 
I'm sure you're seeing just how powerful
Claude Code can be and are probably super 
excited to use it in your own projects. 
But hold up because we have
more to learn in level three. 
And that's the master section where we're
gonna go through advanced techniques 
Level three is where you become a
Claude Code master by leveraging 
advanced techniques that allow you to
feel the full power of Claude Code. 
We'll cover things like using multiple
instances of Claude Code to develop 
multiple features at the same time. 
Custom commands custom subagent and
using Claude Code with MCP servers. 
First up, let's talk about working
in parallel or using multiple 
Claude Codes at the same time. 
For those of you keeping count,
this is tip 29 and is using parallel 
subagents for planning and exploration. 
This allows Claude to explore
multiple solutions simultaneously, 
and then you pick the best one. 
It's like having a team
brainstorming session. 
All you need to do is ask
Claude to plan and use parallel 
subagents to explore solutions. 
parallel. 
Subagent are great. 
If you wanna explore how to add
complex features to your app or if you 
want to fix narly bugs or problems. 
Now remember at the start of this video
where I use three Claude Code instances to 
work on three features at the same time? 
I'm gonna show you how to do
that using the power of Claude 
Code and Git work trees. 
Git work trees give you isolation that
enables multiple claude agents to work 
on your project without conflicts. 
Just create a hidden folder in your
project I called mine dot trees and 
use the git add commands to create a
work tree for each different feature 
or thread that you wanna work on. 
Once the work trees are created, you can
spin up a terminal session for each work 
tree and then run Claude Code in each. 
Here's me doing that in cursor, but
you can also do it in your terminal. 
This gives you a beautiful,
clean git history that's easy 
to understand and review. 
Using Claude Code and git work trees
allows you to work on multiple features 
at the same time, on the same code base
without running into issues down the line. 
When you're done, just ask Claude Code
to merge each of these work trees in your 
folder together and fix any conflicts. 
And boom. 
Thanks to Claude Code and using multiple
Claude Code instances and Git work 
trees, you can have a week's worth of
development done in just a few minutes. 
Now that's how to use
Claude code in parallel. 
Next up is the advanced
customization section. 
And the next tip is using custom commands. 
They're basically like having prompting
shortcuts for Claude Code to act on 
repetitive tasks versus typing out the
same long prompts over and over again. 
Now, the easiest way to make custom
slash commands is just to ask 
Claude to do it for you, but if you
wanna do it manually, here's how 
to set up custom commands yourself. 
Create a commands folder in dot Claude
folder in your working directory. 
Then add a markdown file with
the name of your command, 
for example, change log.md. 
Your command file should have a
description of what the command does, 
the list of allowed tools, usually
things like bash, read and write, 
and the actual command prompts, which
is what you want the command to do 
Command prompts can go beyond just plain
text and include things like arguments 
for dynamic input, bash commands,
and things like file references. 
A Pro tip here is that custom
commands can be project specific. 
Or they can apply to all
your Claude Code projects. 
And this is called a personal command. 
One more thing to note here
is that custom commands don't 
automatically get added to context. 
So if you want something to always
be added to context, for example, 
information about your application,
put these in the Claude.md file 
that always gets added to context. 
Custom commands don't 
this brings us to tip 34, which
is using specialized subagents. 
Just like custom commands, you can
create custom subagents These are 
specialized AI assistants with custom
prompts and tool permissions that can 
handle specific tasks autonomously. 
And just like custom commands, they
can be project specific or they can 
be personal and apply to all projects. 
For example, you may wanna create
custom or specialized subagent for 
things like user experience design. 
API design, security review, running
tests, or database administration, 
and other domain specific tasks. 
Each subagent has specific tools that
it can access and a domain specific 
purpose reflected in its system. 
Prompt. 
The easiest way to create custom
subagent is to use the slash agents 
command in Claude Code This is
another example of using Claude Code 
to help you use Claude Code better. 
There's a wizard that walks you through
setting up a new agent, and this is much 
easier than setting it up yourself because
Claude does a heavy lifting for you. 
In this example, I'm setting up an
agent to do Mixpanel Analytics, and 
here's what's going on under the hood. 
Each agent has a markdown file,
which specifies its agent type. 
Usage, accessible tools and
system prompts, which gives you an 
overview of what the agent does. 
You can view all the agents that you've
created with the slash agents command. 
Once you've created your subagents, Claude
will automatically know that they exist. 
It'll understand what it's used for
based on what's in the usage field 
description in your agent, markdown
file, and it'll automatically delegate 
tasks to your subagent when relevant. 
Claude will also use these
subagents if you explicitly 
ask for them in your prompt. 
So for example, you could say, Hey,
use the test, run a subagent in 
order to run these tests, or use
the database administration agent 
to, make sure that the queries
are correct for, this new feature. 
Now the final thing in this
advanced section is using 
Claude Code with MCP servers. 
Now, what happens when you wanna extend
Claude Code's capabilities to take actions 
in third party tools like databases or
tools like Figma or Canva, this is where 
model context protocol or MCP comes in. 
, here are some ways that I like to
use MCP servers with Claude Code. 
First up is database MCPS. 
These are great for doing
direct database work. 
I've used the MongoDB MCP, the Postgres
MCP server, as well as the Supabase 
MCP server for various database related
things in the apps that I've built. 
Next up is a playwright
MCP for browser automation. 
This is great because it
allows Claude Code to actually. 
Visually see your application, and your
web ui, and it's great for things like 
testing and, finding and fixing bugs. 
Finally, there's a Figma MCP, which is
great for going from design to code. 
Now, there's many other
MCP servers out there. 
I'm actually curious if there's a
particular MCP server that you found 
most useful let me know in the comments. 
But those are just three that I like these
capabilities are incredibly powerful and 
I think they'll become even more powerful
as the MCP server ecosystem matures. 
So that brings us to
the end of level three. 
That's the master section of Claude Code. 
We've gone from beginner, where we've
looked at the foundations to intermediate, 
where we looked at it, enhanced
workflows to the master section where 
we've covered advanced techniques for
getting the most out of Claude Code. 
Congrats on making it
this far in the video. 
but before we end off, let's talk
about a very important thing with 
AI coding tools and especially
with Claude Code, and that's money. 
How much does Claude Code cost
and is it worth the money? 
Now, unfortunately, there's no
free version of Claude Code, but 
there is two ways to access it. 
The first way is via one of the
Claude paid plans, and there's two 
of them that you can choose from. 
The first one is a $20 a month pro plan. 
You can use this to get
started or to play around with. 
And when you're serious about building,
I'd recommend the max plan, which goes for 
either a hundred dollars or $200 a month. 
The MAX 5X plan gets you five x
higher rate limits than the PRO 
plan for a hundred dollars a month,
and the MAX 20X plan gets you 20 x 
higher rate limits at $200 a month. 
This is a plan that I personally
use, and I'd recommend it if you're 
serious about AI coding tools. 
But you know, pick whatever
plan fits your budget. 
The second way to use Claude Code is
through the anthropic API, but this 
is just ridiculously expensive, and
unless you're part of a large company 
that will pay for the Anthropic API
usage for you, i'd recommend picking 
a Claude, pro or max plan that fits
your budget and not looking back. 
Quick note. 
Anthropic announced that at the end
of August they're gonna be imposing 
additional rate limits and that's
weekly rate limits on Claude Max users. 
I'm not quite sure how this is
going to impact Claude users. 
I don't think the impact is gonna
be that big, I still think Claude 
is good value for the money, but
we have to see what these rate 
limits do come the end of August. 
That brings us to the end of this video. 
I hope it helped Demystify Claude
code and made you super excited to 
build and unleash your creativity
with Claude Code by your side.

don't forget to like and subscribe 
And if you thought there was a
feature that was really cool, or 
maybe something that I didn't cover in
this video, it could be about Claude 
Code, it could be about AI coding in
general let me know in the comments 
and I'll see you in the next one.
