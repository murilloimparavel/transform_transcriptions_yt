Claude Code 2.0 is smarter,
faster, and more agentic than ever. 
But here's the problem. 
It's so packed full of features
that most people are gonna miss 
the stuff that actually matters. 
The good news is that I've spent
weeks testing out all the new updates 
in Claude Code 2.0 and seeing how
they fit in to real world projects. 
And in this video I'm gonna save you hours
and hours by showing you the essential 
features of Claude Code 2.0 that you need
to apply to your coding workflows today. 
We are gonna cover the 11 essential
upgrades that every Claude 
code user, new or old , needs
to know about Claude code 2.0. 
And it's gonna be organized
into three clear sections. 
Section one is about must know features. 
We'll explore smarter and faster models. 
The Explore sub-agent for
code-based search and the checkpoint 
system to easily undo changes. 
Section two is about level up features. 
These features boost productivity
when you're using Claude 
code for real world projects. 
We'll cover things like advanced
context management and the interactive 
question tool, as well as using
Claude code outside the terminal 
with the new VS Code extension and
Claude code on the web and mobile app. 
Section three is about
power user features. 
These features give you advanced
customizations and let you push 
Claude code to its agent limits. 
We'll cover things like discovering
Claude code best practices with plugins, 
teaching Claude specialized knowledge
with skills and building custom 
agents with the new Claude agents SDK. 
So whether you're a Claude code
beginner or power user, I guarantee 
that you can learn something from
this video that's gonna help you 
level up with Claude code 2.0. 
But before we dive in, I'm Avthar and
I teach people about the best AI coding 
tools and how to get the most out of them,
no matter your skill or experience level. 
so if you're trying to level up with AI
coding, please subscribe to the channel 
and turn on notifications for new videos. 
And one more thing. 
If you're new to Claude Code or want a
refresher on the basics, I actually have 
another video that covers six months
of Claude Code lessons in 27 minutes. 
Many viewers have called it
the most useful video on Claude 
code that they've ever watched. 
So check it out before or
after you watch this video. 
It's linked in the video description. 
With that out the way, let's dive
into section one, which is a must 
know features of Claude code 2.0. 
Essential number one is probably the
biggest upgrade in Claude code 2.0. 
And that's new models. 
Claude Code now has three models that you
can choose from for your coding tasks. 
First, there's sonnet 4.5, which is
the new default model in Claude Code. 
Anthropic claims that sonnet. 
4.5 is the best coding model in the world. 
And the benchmarks back this up. 
Sonnet 4.5 beat out Opus 4.1, GPT-5
Codex from OpenAI, and Gemini 2.5 Pro 
from Google on the SWE bench software
engineering benchmark, which measures real 
world software engineering capabilities. 
Sonet 4.5 can now also handle longer,
more complex tasks than before with 
Anthropic claiming it can focus for more
than 30 hours on complex multi-step tasks. 
I've been using sonnet 4.5 as my default
for both planning and execution in Claude 
code, and honestly, it's the real deal. 
It's definitely replaced Opus 4.1 for
me as a model that I use the most. 
Second, we have Haiku 4.5, which is
the second new model, and it's also the 
fastest and cheapest model in Claude. 
Haiku 4.5. 
Best compares to Sonet four. 
It's twice as fast and operates
at one third of the cost while 
maintaining similar coding performance. 
And my own experience
with Haiku confirms this. 
It's blazing fast and really useful
for straightforward coding tasks. 
One of the coolest things about Haiku
4.5 is that when you're in plan mode, 
Claude code automatically uses sonet 4.5
for planning and haiku for execution. 
This is nicknamed Sonet Plan. 
Now, if you remember the old Opus
Plan mode, this is similar to that. 
I think this might be the new sweet
spot for people because it gives you the 
power of sonnet 4.5 To plan and reason. 
While using the faster, cheaper
model, haiku 4.5 for implementation. 
The third model in Claude code 2.0
is Opus 4.1, which is a premium model 
for your most demanding coding tasks. 
Opus 4.1 also came out on top in
open AI's, GDP-val, which is a newly 
published evaluation framework that
measures AI performance on real world 
economically valuable work tasks. 
Opus 4.1 came out on beating out
the likes of GPT-5, Gemini and Grok 
as a best performing model on real
world tasks from fields like finance, 
healthcare, and customer support. 
Finally, be aware that the models you can
access now depend on your Claude plan. 
Pro users on the $20 a month
plan will have access to 
sonnet and haiku, but no opus. 
While Max users will have access to
all models on the $200 a month plan. 
The second must know feature in Claude
Code 2.0 is the explore subagent. 
This is a specialized agent
designed to rapidly gather 
context from your code base. 
Exploring a code base is one of those
tasks that's both common and important. 
Whether you're planning to implement
a feature, writing documentation, or 
just getting up to speed on a project. 
The explore subagent is powered
by the new model Haiku 4.5, which 
means it's fast and efficient at
searching through your code base. 
A cool thing about the explore
subagent is that Claude will 
actually use it automatically. 
You don't need to do anything
differently in order to benefit from it. 
Claude will automatically use the
explore subagent when it detects 
that the task that you're asking
for matches its capabilities. 
But you can also explicitly invoke the
explore subagent by prompting Claude 
using phrases like "Explore the code
base" or "use the explore subagent". 
You can even specify how thorough
you want the search to be. 
Use the keyword "quick"
for a basic search. 
"Medium" for moderate exploration,
or "very thorough" for comprehensive 
analysis across multiple locations. 
For example, you could say, "use
the explore subagent with medium 
thoroughness to find all analytics
tracking events in the app." 
The third must know feature in
Claude code 2.0 is one of the most 
requested from the community, and
that's checkpoints and rewind. 
With checkpoints Claude code now
automatically saves the state of 
your code and the AI conversation
before each Claude initiated change. 
One checkpoint is created for
every prompt that you give. 
The best part is that you don't need
to do anything to enable checkpoints. 
It just happens automatically. 
If the AI starts going down the
wrong path, you can instantly 
rewind to a previous checkpoint
with the rewind command. 
Just type slash rewind to view
all the checkpoints and select 
which one you wanna go back to. 
You've got three options
when it comes to rewinding. 
You can rewind the code,
the context, or both. 
And it's this ability to revert back both
code and potentially poisoned conversation 
context that makes a checkpoint feature
such a game changer in Claude code 
2.0 because it allows you to explore
new directions with confidence without 
fear of messing up  because reverting
is as easy as the rewind command. 
Finally, two pro tips or checkpoints. 
First. 
Once you rewind to a checkpoint, you
can only go backwards from there. 
You can't jump back and forth. 
Second checkpoints isn't
a replacement for Git. 
It's a compliment. 
It's designed for quick session level
recovery and doesn't cover changes 
made by Bash or direct file edits. 
So you still wanna use git for overall
version control for your projects. 
Essential number four. 
And the final feature in this
must know section is something 
that you'll notice immediately. 
Claude code 2.0 has a completely refreshed
terminal interface and it's really clean. 
The enhanced terminal UI is
smoother, snappier, and way 
more informative than before. 
The change that I personally like the most
is a new crab mascot called Claude that 
shows up whenever you start Claude Code. 
It's a nice touch. 
There's also a new animation for thinking
keywords like Think and Ultra think 
with the thinking mode now automatically
turning on when you type these keywords. 
Then there's a status bar which is
much more customizable now, giving 
you better context of your project at
a glance with information like which 
folder and which Git branch you're on. 
To configure the status bar, use
the slash status line command. 
I keep my status line showing the
current folder and current git 
branch because I work on multiple
projects at the same time with Claude 
and it helps me not get confused. 
And that wraps up Section one, the
must know features of Claude code. 
Let's move on to section two, where
we're gonna learn about the level 
Up features that are gonna help
you take your productivity with 
Claude code to the next level. 
Alright, this is section two where
we're gonna cover the new features of 
Claude code that are gonna help you
level up from just using Claude code 
to being truly productive with it. 
We'll cover things like the new VS code
extension, the new interactive question 
tool, and using Claude code outside the
terminal on the web and mobile apps. 
if you're used to working in IDEs
like VS Code or cursor or windsurf, 
the new VS Code extension for
Claude code is something that 
you should a hundred percent use. 
It's got a completely redesigned
interface that lives in its own tab. 
Previously you had to use a built
in terminal, but now you get a 
much more cohesive experience. 
My favorite thing about the Claude
code vs code extension is that 
you can view and edit files while
prompting Claude all in one place. 
This really speeds up workflows like
reviewing PRDs or product requirements 
docs reviewing engineering plans or
inputting API keys in environment variable 
files for Claude to take action on. 
With the VS code extension, you
also get real time inline diffs and 
drag and drop support for adding
files and folders Right into chat. 
The Claude code extension is available on
the VS code marketplace, which means you 
can use it in VS code, but also in cursor,
windsurf and other VS Code base IDEs. 
To install it, just search for
Claude code in the VS Code app 
store and then once installed, you
can open it from the settings menu. 
Or you can just use the slash IDE
command to switch back and forth. 
Personally, I'm a fan
of the new ID extension. 
I found myself switching back and
forth between the terminal and using 
Claude code in cursor, and so I
highly recommend giving this a try. 
This next level up feature
completely changes how and 
where you can use Claude code. 
You can now run coding tasks
in sandboxes directly from the 
Claude mobile app or web app. 
This is huge for developing on the go. 
Let's zoom in on sandboxes. 
When you kick off a coding task
from web or mobile app, it runs 
on anthropic managed sandboxes. 
Each session runs in its own
isolated environment with 
real time progress tracking. 
And you can be as hands-on
or as hands-off as you like. 
You can let Claude run wild or
actively steer Claude and adjust 
course as it's working through tasks. 
You can also run multiple tasks in
parallel across different GitHub repos. 
So you could have Claude working on a
bug fix in one repo while simultaneously 
updating documentation in another repo. 
All from your phone or browser. 
But my favorite feature in the web and
mobile app experience is teleporting. 
Teleporting allows you to
easily switch your web session 
to your local dev environment. 
It moves all the context, all
the messages, and all the edits 
to your local environment so
that you can stay in the flow. 
This makes it super easy to
switch back and forth between 
local and remote execution. 
To get started, just connect
your GitHub to Claude. 
Select your permission
level and you're good to go. 
Quick note. 
Accessing Claude in the web and
mobile app is currently a beta 
feature in research preview. 
So if you don't see it yet, hopefully
you'll be able to access it very soon. 
The next level up feature is a new
set of context management tools. 
And if you've ever hit limits
unexpectedly, then these features 
are gonna be super helpful to you. 
First, you've got two new commands to
help you understand your usage Better. 
The slash context command
lets you visualize the context 
of your current session. 
And the slash usage command shows
your usage and tells you if you're 
close to hitting any limits in your
current session or this week or month. 
These are great for staying aware
of where you stand so that you 
never run into rate limits mid task. 
Next up. 
Longtime Claude code users can attest
that performance on a task is much worse 
after an auto compact happens mid-task. 
So a pro tip for using Claude code is
that you can actively clear the context 
window versus letting it auto compact. 
And there are actually
three ways to do this now. 
There's the slash clear command
which resets everything to zero. 
It's a complete fresh start. 
I recommend using this when you're
switching to develop a totally new 
feature or investigating a totally
new problem and you don't need any 
other context that you built up. 
Then there's a slash compact command,
which clears conversation history, 
but keeps a summary in context, which
is what happens during auto compact 
when your context window gets full. 
The compact command is useful after you've
finished a smaller part of a bigger plan. 
So you can carry some knowledge of what's
happened before into future subtasks. 
And then there's a new feature
called micro compact which is 
a smarter version of compact. 
But this isn't a command that you can run. 
It's actually an automatic command
that Claude calls to clear all the tool 
call results when context gets large. 
This helps extend your session length
without manual intervention and 
it's brand new in Claude Code 2.0. 
The final feature in the Level
Up section is all about helping 
you prompt Claude better. 
The big feature here is the
interactive question tool. 
Claude can ask you questions
when it needs more input. 
This makes the experience of using
Claude code much more conversational, 
especially if you're in plan mode, where
Claude will ask clarifying questions 
before diving into an implementation. 
This helps you get better results
from Claude because it'll ask for 
clarification before implementing versus
you giving it feedback after it's done. 
This pattern reminds me of ChatGPT,
and in particular, the deep 
research feature where it asks you
clarifying questions before it goes 
off and compiles research reports. 
It always forced me to think, what am
I actually trying to do here, which 
is just helpful for better thinking,
but also helps me get better results. 
So I'm really happy to see this
kind of pattern being adopted more 
widely in tools like Claude Code. 
This brings us to the end of section
two, and I'm sure you're excited to 
use some of these features to level
up your productivity with Claude Code. 
But hold up because we've got more
to learn in the final section of 
this Claude code 2.0 essentials video
and that's the power user features. 
Alright. 
Section three is for the
Claude code power users. 
In this section we'll look at advanced
features that let you customize 
Claude code to your specific needs
and let you get even more done. 
We'll cover how to teach Claude
specialized tasks with skills. 
How to discover and share best practices
with plugins and building your own agent. 
With a Claude agent. 
SDK. 
First up is one of the most powerful
and most talked about features in 
Claude Code 2.0 that helps Claude
level up with specialized knowledge 
and that feature is skills. 
Skills are packaged instructions to
teach Claude your way of working. 
You can think of skills as
a way to load specialized 
knowledge into Claude on demand. 
Instead of building custom agents
for everything, you package knowledge 
into reusable capabilities that
Claude loads when it needs them. 
At its core a skill is
actually quite simple. 
It's just a folder with a skill. 
Dot. 
Md file. 
The file starts with a name, a
description, and then contains 
instructions, code, and resources, as well
as pointers to other files in the folder. 
And what's cool is that once you create
a skill, you can use it everywhere. 
In Claude Code, in the Claude
app and the Claude API. 
Skills use progressive disclosure where
Claude will only initially see the skill 
names and descriptions, and then load full
skills only when relevant to the task. 
This helps keep your context window
free from bloat, which is really 
helpful for managing token usage limits. 
Anthropic launched a number of pre-built
skills for Claude code, including skills 
for working with common file formats
like PDF Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. 
and an example skill repo, which contains
things like a web app testing skill for 
testing local web apps using playwright. 
An MCP server guide for creating
MCP servers and even a skill 
creator skill, which you can
use to build your own skills. 
And the community is already building
amazing third party skills from test 
driven development frameworks to eub book
analyzers and meeting insights tools. 
You install skills using plugins,
which we're gonna cover next. 
Skills is one feature that I plan
to experiment with a whole lot more. 
So let me know in the comments if
you've tried skills and what your 
experience with it has been so far. 
The next power user feature is plugins. 
Plugins are a way to discover
and share best practices and 
customizations for using Claude code. 
Plugins are a big deal because it
means you can now easily use the 
best customizations from other
Claude core users without having to 
replicate or set them up yourself. 
A plugin can contain custom commands,
subagents, MCP servers, hooks, and skills. 
To get started with plugins,
use the slash plugin command to 
browse and install new plugins. 
A key concept for plugins is marketplaces. 
You can think of a marketplace as a
collection of plugins that's made by a 
certain developer or a certain company. 
To add a new marketplace, you
also use the slash plugin command. 
Companies and individual Claude Code
users like you and me, can create 
these marketplaces, and they usually
take the form of a GitHub repo. 
Since launch, there are now hundreds
of plugins out there, but let me show 
you three of my favorites that I found
useful so that you can get started with 
plugins if you're curious about them. 
First up is the Claude code marketplace
from Anthropic itself, which has things 
like the multi-agent, feature development
workflows, and Git commit plugins. 
Second is the every plugin
for compound engineering. 
This is a set of customizations
to help Claude code self-improve. 
And make the next feature you
make always easier than the last. 
And third is the agents repo
by Seth Hobson, which contains 
over 60 plugins for intelligent
automation in software development. 
For more plugins, there's many
community aggregators out there like 
claude marketplaces.com where you
can find more plugins to try out. 
Just be careful to verify it's
not shady before you use them. 
And a final pro tip to with plugins is
that they can sometimes take up a lot 
of context so you can enable or disable
them on demand to avoid context overhead. 
The final power user feature
is a Claude Agent SDK. 
This is previously known
as a Claude Code SDK. 
The Claude agent SDK is
the perfect foundation for 
creating your own AI agents. 
It's based on the idea that Claude Code
and its agent harness of tools and a file 
system is actually the perfect foundation
for creating custom agents in general. 
The Claude Agent SDK gives you
and your team access to the same 
core tools that power Claude Code. 
Including its tool, execution
system, context management, 
and permission framework. 
For example, I use the Claude agent,
SDK to create a personal travel agent 
for my wife and I to plan our upcoming
travel according to our preferences. 
And of course, I use Claude
Code to do the implementation. 
Anthropic also built their
GitHub actions with this SDK. 
The SDK supports creating custom
subagent and defining hook 
behaviors programmatically. 
If you'd like a full deep dive on
the Claude Agents SDK, let me know 
in the comments and if there's enough
demand, I'll be sure to make one. 
So that brings us to the end of section
three, which is a power user features 
but before we end off, there's one more
essential piece that I want to cover. 
And for some people it might be
the most essential piece of all. 
And that's cost. 
First up. 
Claude code is still only
available on the paid plans. 
There's no free version yet. 
And the two paid plans that you can choose
from are the Pro Plan and the Max Plan. 
For the Pro Plan, it's $20 a month. 
This is the cheapest plan for
Claude Code and it gives you 
access to Haiku 4.5 and Sonnet 4.5. 
The pro plan is what I recommend you
start with if you're new to clock 
code or just use it occasionally. 
For the max plan, you've
actually got two options. 
Max five x is a hundred dollars a
month and max 20 x is $200 a month. 
The five x plan gives you
five x higher rate limits. 
And the 20 x plan gives you
20 x higher rate limits. 
Both the MAX plans give you access
to all models, meaning that you get 
access to Haiku, sonnet, and Opus. 
I recommend the Max plan if
you're serious about using Claude 
code for real world projects. 
It's a plan that I personally
use and it's definitely worth it 
if you've got the budget for it. 
Thirdly, you can also use the
API for billing, but I'd only 
recommend this if your company
is paying for Claude API access. 
Otherwise, I've just found
it way too expensive. 
So if you're paying for Claude yourself,
I'd recommend getting a Pro or a max plan. 
Well, that's it for this video. 
Claude Code 2.0 is a massive
upgrade, and I'm super excited 
to see what you'll build with it. 
If you learn something from this video,
please subscribe to the channel and 
share it with your friends and coworkers. 
And if there's anything you wanna learn
more about, let me know in the comments. 
I read every single one of them. 
Catch you in the next one.
