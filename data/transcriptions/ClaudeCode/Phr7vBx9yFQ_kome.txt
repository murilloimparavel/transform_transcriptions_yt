Okay then gang, in this lesson I want to 
talk about something called sub aents 
which are really cool and they allow you 
to basically create a whole team working 
on your project where each sub agent can 
have a different area of expertise that 
can be isolated and configured to work 
on certain tasks. For example, we could 
make a unit test agent whose expertise 
and function would be to really hone in 
on writing and running tests. Or we 
could make a sub agent who specializes 
in security audits. We could make a UX 
reviewer who specializes in providing 
feedback for new components by viewing 
them in a browser, etc. Now, each of 
these sub aents all run independently 
from each other. They have their own 
system prompts, tools they're allowed to 
run, and their own context window. So, 
they're a really good way of isolating 
certain workflows and tasks. And what's 
really cool is that Claude Code can 
delegate tasks to them when it needs to. 
So you can kind of think of claude code 
as being maybe a senior developer 
working on tasks who then instructs 
these sub aents to carry out certain 
work. And one of the main benefits of 
working this way is that each sub aent 
has a specialized expertise which we can 
fine-tune to excel in a particular area 
through detail system prompts. Also 
because each sub aent has their own 
isolated context window. It keeps their 
context clean and focused leading to I 
think better results a lot of the time. 
And it also means the main thread stays 
cleaner and trimmer if we do this 
correctly because we're delegating tasks 
to those sub aents. So it reduces the 
context overload in your main session. 
So then in this lesson we're going to 
make a sub agent who can use the 
playright MCP server to preview and 
review the UI UX of new components once 
they've been made. And the workflow is 
going to look something like this. We're 
going to use the custom slash command to 
tell Claude Code to make a new UI 
component for us. Inside that command, 
we're going to add an instruction 
telling it to invoke the UX reviewer sub 
aent to review its work after it's made 
code edits. That sub aents going to use 
playright to open a browser and look at 
the component from a UX perspective. 
Then it's going to provide feedback to 
the main thread on clawed code which 
will make edits to the component based 
on that feedback. If needed, it can ask 
the UX reviewer again to review the code 
or review the uh component in a browser 
and provide more feedback until 
eventually everyone's happy and the 
component is finished. So let's give 
this a whirl. So then let's start by 
making a new sub agent which we can do 
by coming into the claude code chat 
session and using a command which is 
forward/ agents. Now when we do that 
we're going to see a list of agents 
you've already created. Now, we've not 
created any. So, we can make one by 
selecting this create new agent option. 
Once we've done that, we can choose a 
scope for this new agent, either project 
or personal. I'm going to select the 
project scope so that anyone working on 
this project can use the sub agent. 
Then, we're going to get two options. 
You can get Claude to generate one for 
you, or you can manually make one from 
scratch. Now, what I'd like to do is 
have Claude make one for me, then just 
change it where I see fit. So, let's 
select that first option. And then we're 
asked to describe what this agent should 
do and when it should be used. And I'm 
just going to paste in a summary of this 
agent now which says expert UI and UX 
engineer who reviews the UI and UX of 
React components in a browser using 
Playright, takes screenshots, then 
offers feedback on how to improve the 
component in terms of visual design, 
user experience, and accessibility. So 
then I'm going to hit enter and Claude 
Code's going to go ahead and make this 
new agent for us. 
Now, at some point, it's going to ask 
you what tools you want to provide your 
agent with. And the default option is to 
allow all tools, but I'm going to 
unselect the edit tools because I don't 
want to give the agent the power to edit 
files. I only want it to review the 
components and offer feedback. It's also 
going to ask you which AI mode you want 
to use for the sub agent, and I'm going 
to select the Sonic 4 model. Then it's 
going to ask you what color you want the 
sub agent to use when it's providing 
updates in the terminal. I'm going to go 
for the purple color. You choose 
whatever you want. And then finally, 
it's going to give you a summary of the 
agent it's making, which you can confirm 
by pressing enter. Okay. So, we can see 
that now we have this project agent 
called UI UX- reviewer that uses the 
Sonic model. Let's close this off. And 
if we open up this file tree, we should 
see inside the claude folder, an agents 
folder with this markdown file for the 
agent. So we've got some front matter at 
the top, which is the name of the agent 
a description. And then down here, the 
tools that it's allowed to use. Now, 
it's added the playright one right here, 
or a few of the playright tools rather, 
because we specifically said in the 
summary, we wanted to use playright, the 
model, and the color. Then a bit of a 
description down here. Then we've got 
the actual workflow. So the setup, the 
visual documentation, how to analyze, uh 
some testing methodology. We're not 
going to read all this, but essentially 
it's created this for us. And the job of 
this agent now is to review components 
using the Playright MCP in a browser. 
And you can edit this, by the way, if 
you want to. It's basically like a 
gigantic prompt for the sub agent which 
gets used when the sub aent gets 
invoked. So by all means go through this 
and just edit anything that you don't 
agree with or any additional information 
that you want to add, just add it. Okay, 
so now we've got this sub aent created. 
We can go back to the custom UI 
component command we created earlier in 
the course. And remember this command 
instructs claw code to make a new UI 
component based on certain criteria. And 
now at the end I'm going to paste in one 
final instruction which tells Claude to 
invoke the new sub agent we just created 
and ask it for feedback. Once it has 
that feedback it should implement it by 
updating the component. And then finally 
if it needs to it can ask for another 
review and more feedback. So then now 
everything is kind of set up and ready 
to go. So let's give this a shot. And 
remember, we need to exit out of claude 
code first of all because we just made a 
change to this command. And then we're 
going to start the session back up 
again. 
All right, then. So, let's use the UI 
component 
tool if I can spell it. Components like 
so. And then the component name is going 
to be modal. And I'm going to say make a 
clean modern looking modal which also 
has a semi transparent 
backdrop. 
All right. So, press enter. 
All right. And we can see already that 
it has a little to-do list that it's 
going to work on. And right at the 
bottom down here, it's going to say 
review the component with the UI SL uh 
hyphen UX - reviewer agent. So that's 
the final step. Okay, so it wants to do 
something. Yep, we'll allow that. And 
I'm going to allow for the rest of the 
session. 
Okay, so now you can see it's invoked 
this UIUX reviewer and that reviewer 
wants to open up a browser. Now, in 
order to do that, it wants to start the 
dev server. So, I'm going to let it do 
that. 
And now it wants to navigate to the 
preview page, which is where Claude Code 
added that component to when it created 
it. So, let's allow it to do this. 
And now on my other screen, I can see 
it's opened up the browser. It's over 
here. You can see. All right. 
And it's asking me for permission to 
take a screenshot. Yes, I'm going to 
allow it to do that. 
So something else you can do through 
playright is click elements on a page. 
And now it's asking for permission to do 
that. So we'll say yes. 
And this is taking a long time by the 
way because there's so many different 
variants that Claude Code created for 
this modal. There's about seven or eight 
different things it needs to do on the 
web page to test everything. 
All right. And now it wants to resize 
the browser width. So, it's even testing 
for smaller device screens, which is 
really nice. So, I'm going to allow it 
to do that. 
All right. So, eventually it finished 
its review process and you can see now 
it's made some additional edits and 
these are all the features it's 
implemented. So, we've got the color 
variants. We've got the different sizes. 
We've made sure it's good for 
accessibility. Uh we've got these 
different interactions so we can close 
via the cross button, escape key, or the 
backdrop click. Um these are the files 
created for the model and the test. And 
then it's updated the page, the preview 
page right here to have interactive 
demos. So, it says right here, the UI UX 
reviewer gave it a five out of five 
stars and marked it production ready. 
Well, that is really good. So, it 
obviously did a good job of making these 
components. So, now let's view these in 
a browser. All right. So, I'm just on 
the preview page and I've scrolled all 
the way down to the modal components. 
So, we've got buttons here to open the 
modules. So, I could click on primary 
and yeah, that looks pretty good. So, we 
can close it via the cross or clicking 
over here. I'm going to try the 
secondary one and then press escape. 
Yeah, that closes it. Confirm. All 
right. And then we'll click on cancel. 
And then finally, we'll click on the 
cross. So, we've got these different 
variants, which is really nice. 
Different sizes. So, that's small. Uh, 
medium. I think that's a little bigger. 
Large. Yeah, a little bit bigger again. 
All right. So, these are the features 
it's implemented. So, that's nice. It's 
kind of documented it for me as well. 
So, these are actually using I think the 
card component because the card 
components are up here. So, you know, 
like I said earlier on in the series 
that Claude Code does get a little bit 
giddy sometimes. It likes to use the 
work it's done elsewhere in the 
application. So I think this is just an 
example of that. It's reusing the card 
component to tell me about this modal 
component it just created. So kudos. 
That's very nice. Anyway, all looks 
pretty good. Maybe I would make some 
tweaks here and there, but I think it's 
done a good job of creating and also 
testing this component in the browser. 
And one more thing really quickly. Just 
because we've made a sub agent to 
automate the review process, it doesn't 
mean you shouldn't review the work 
yourself. both in the browser and in the 
code. This is something I think is 
really important and something I always 
do to stay in the loop because even 
though everything looks okay in the 
browser, it doesn't mean it's coded 
correctly and you might find something 
you don't like. Also, if you're not 
looking over the code that Claude 
produces, you're going to find yourself 
out of the loop very quickly and find it 
harder to navigate the codebase in the 
future when you do need to dig into the 
weeds.
