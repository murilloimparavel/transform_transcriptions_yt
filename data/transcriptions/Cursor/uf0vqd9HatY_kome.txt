Cursor, the leading AI code editor, just 
announced their biggest release ever, 
Cursor 2.0. Now, with this release comes 
a whole new AI coding model that the 
Cursor team put together themselves, as 
well as a whole new interface for 
interacting with the AI agents that are 
modifying your code. So, today we're 
going to take a look at all of that and 
build an application from start to 
finish. And I'll show you exactly how to 
use all of these new tools. I want to 
thank the Cursor team for giving me 
early access to play around with Cursor 
2.0. And I've been very impressed with 
the product so far. First off, Cursor is 
a desktop application, so you're going 
to want to download it. And to do that, 
you'll just go to cursor.com, hit the 
download button, and then install it. On 
the pricing front, it is a paid product, 
but there is a oneweek free trial. So, I 
suggest you start with that, and then 
upgrade to a pro plan if you think it's 
worth your time. Keep in mind it can get 
pretty expensive. So for me personally 
as a professional developer, I fall into 
the ultra tier and sometimes use their 
usagebased pricing which is described in 
their documentation. Okay. Now once 
you've downloaded Cursor and installed 
it, you're going to open it up. It's 
going to look something like this. 
Cursor works with files on your 
computer. So your options are to either 
open a project, which is just a folder 
on your computer, or to clone a git repo 
into a folder. So, I'm going to open up 
this folder here, which is really just 
an empty project. I haven't done 
anything in here just yet. And right 
now, we're looking at the agent view, 
which is the new thing in cursor 2.0. 
They're moving towards a more agentic 
AIcentric approach, as opposed to the 
editor view, which is going to show you 
all of the files and the file contents. 
So, let's stay in this new agent view 
for now, and we'll see how far we can 
get. To get the project started quickly 
and have a nice baseline to work with, 
I'm going to use create Vololo app, 
which is my free and open-source starter 
kit. You can check it out on GitHub in 
the description, or you can just ask 
cursor to use it. So, I'm going to say, 
please use create Vololo app to start 
the project. And right here we're going 
to use the agent mode which is going to 
allow cursor to actually run commands 
and modify files. And we're going to use 
the composer one model. This is the new 
AI model that the cursor team has 
actually created. But you can always 
switch to other leading industry models 
in the dropdown. I usually use sonnet 
45, but I'm looking forward to trying 
out composer 1 because it is very fast. 
So, I'll go ahead and submit that 
request and I'm going to run this 
command. What this is going to do is 
just set up a basic front end, backend, 
and local database that I can work with. 
So, I can just define specific features 
for my app instead of trying to set up 
all of this stuff from scratch. Okay, 
looks like the project was set up. Now, 
we can go ahead and start the server. 
It's going to run pnpm rundev. And I'm 
actually going to click this to see 
where the app is running. 
Looks like it's over here on port 5501. 
Okay, there we go. This is the basis of 
our app. Now, I'm going to open a new 
agent, which is going to allow me to 
give cursor a fresh context. That way, 
it's not bogged down in the details of 
setting up the project, and instead, I'm 
just going to have it focused on the 
specific features that I describe. And 
to start, I'm going to want to customize 
my project. I want to build a habit 
tracking app where you can plant your 
habits and then see them grow over time. 
So, I'll describe all of that. And I'm 
going to switch this agent to use the 
plan mode so that before it actually 
builds anything, it's going to create a 
detailed plan that it will follow and 
take things step by step. This planning 
and then building approach is really 
effective because it allows you to 
correct the AI before it goes down and 
makes a bunch of changes that you didn't 
necessarily want. So, I'm going to use 
this new voice input method and describe 
my app. We are building a habit tracking 
app that allows users to plant habits 
and see them grow over time as they 
follow those habits day after day. I've 
described my app and I'll submit the 
request. 
It looks like cursor was able to quickly 
explore the codebase and understand what 
we're working with. And now it's asking 
me for some of the details to clarify 
what I want to build. I've clarified my 
plan for cursor. And now it's going to 
start actually writing this plan. And we 
can see that this composer one model is 
very fast. Now, generally speaking, 
you'll want to spend a good amount of 
time reviewing these plans because once 
the AI implements it, it's harder to fix 
it than to just implement it the right 
way the first time. So, I would review 
this and then when you feel comfortable 
with it, you can go ahead and ask Cursor 
to build it. So, that's exactly what 
we're going to do now. And it's going to 
start working through this to-do list 
that it's put together for itself. 
Cursor is asking me to run a couple of 
commands here. And this is the beautiful 
thing with cursor agents is that they 
can just run commands. They can modify 
files. They can read files and search 
for data. They can look things up 
online. Okay, cursor has finished 
working and it has written 12 different 
files for us. We can see over a thousand 
lines of code. Now we can review these 
changes. And this is another part of 
cursor 2.0 and this whole new view is 
that we can see all of these changes 
file by file. and it makes it a lot more 
convenient to review all in one place 
instead of having to flip around 
different files. So here I can see that 
it's, you know, removed some lines, it's 
added some lines, and quickly navigate 
through all of the changes that it's 
made. Now, in addition to reviewing it 
yourself, you can actually click this 
find issues button and then cursor is 
going to go through on its own and 
review the code looking for any 
potential problems that the 
implementation agent may have caused. 
And looks like this time around the 
agent found no issues. But I love to see 
this direction that cursor is taking of 
having the planning and the review be a 
core part of this implementation flow. 
Prior to cursor 2.0, 0. I've been using 
my own planning and review prompts. You 
can find them on my GitHub, but it's 
great to see them actually incorporating 
this into the core workflow of cursor 
itself. Let's flip over and see what 
this looks like right now. Okay, so we 
got a habits page. Let's create a habit. 
This looks good. Let's say drinking 
water. 
And we want it to be daily. Okay, it 
looks like there's an issue with the 
font color there, but we have some 
plants. Let's plant this flower. I'll 
create it. Okay, so that's not working. 
I can open the dev tools and see that 
there are some issues here. Now, usually 
I would actually go and copy paste these 
into cursor, but I'm going to show you 
another cursor 2.0 feature, which is the 
fact that they've added the browser into 
cursor. So here I'll click connect to 
browser and I'll click Google Chrome. 
And here I'll say, "Please check the 
errors in the browser console log." 
Okay, here it looks like it's going to 
the wrong place. I'm actually going to 
stop it because whatever changes it's 
making, it's making on some poor 
assumptions because when it opened it, 
it wasn't actually looking at the app. 
So, I'm going to go back and I'm 
actually going to click this button 
right here, which will revert the 
changes that it made since this message. 
That way, I can always go back. And this 
is something I love about cursor. It 
doesn't come natively in a lot of other 
AI coding apps. Um, I really like the 
ability to just go back to a previous 
checkpoint. Let me try something a 
little different here. I'm going to say 
browser tab. That way we can see it 
right in here. And I'll say please check 
the error logs. And then I'll give it 
the actual URL so that it goes to the 
right place. 
Check it out. It's actually autonomously 
driving this browser. So, it actually 
went to this page, checked the logs, and 
then seeing that there's an error. Now, 
it's updating the API. It's really 
impressive to see this level of 
interaction directly in the code editor. 
So, now let's go ahead and try to create 
a habit. Create. Okay, so this button is 
still not working. And I wonder if it is 
able to capture the logs from me trying 
to create it. Actually, you know what? I 
just read the message and I think it was 
because the pnpm db push didn't work 
originally. So, I'm gonna go ahead and 
open a new terminal and I'll run that 
directly. Okay, let's try this again. 
Create. Boom. There we go. Great. So, we 
were able to add this habit. Now, let's 
check out the garden. Okay, doesn't 
quite load. Looks like we have 
dev tools right here that we can take a 
look at the logs. 
Again, I don't even have to leave cursor 
anymore to see this stuff, right? I can 
just see what is going on right here. 
And I'll just describe it to cursor. 
I'll just say I see these logs in the 
browser. When I go to the garden page, 
can you take a look? Okay, looks like 
cursor was able to fix the issue. And we 
have our first little habit that gets 
planted. Now, what I'm going to do is 
actually open a new agent and start 
iterating on this. And I'm going to 
actually run two agents in parallel 
because first of all, I want to improve 
the experience on this page and also do 
some cleanup to remove some of the other 
unnecessary pages. So, I'll open up a 
new agent and I'll say, "Please make the 
garden the default page where we land at 
when we go to the app and remove the 
other unnecessary pages other than the 
habits page. So, we'll start that. Then, 
I'm going to start another agent in 
parallel. And I'll say 
we just built a basic habit tracking 
app. And we have the garden page, which 
is supposed to allow us to plant our 
habits. But right now, it seems to just 
automatically plant them for us. And it 
just has a really bland background. So, 
let's plan a much more interesting and 
engaging way to interact with the app. 
And then I'm going to switch it to plan 
mode so that we can have a concrete idea 
of how this will actually work. 
Looks like the other agent has finished. 
I'll take a look. And looks like it's 
modified things in app tsx and the app 
sidebar. That's great. So now when I go 
to the app, I see the garden and I see 
the habits. So this all looks good. I'm 
going to go ahead and click keep all. 
You don't really have to. cursor does 
make changes to the files as it goes. So 
to undo the changes, you have to reject 
them. But keeping them just basically 
makes it easier for you to see further 
changes that are made, but it's not 
strictly necessary to keep accepting 
them all of the time. The other agent 
has created a plan, so I'm going to go 
ahead and review that. And the proposed 
changes sound great to me, so I'm going 
to go ahead and click build. The thing I 
really like about this cursor 2.0 0 
workflow is that it finally moves you 
beyond the individual files and helps 
you focus on specific features that 
you're building out while still giving 
you access to those files and seeing the 
changes just in a much more consolidated 
and streamlined way. Cursor has finished 
this other feature. So I can review 
that. I can take a look at the 
individual files. But let's see what it 
looks like in the browser. Let me create 
a habit again. 
Seems like it's having issues with the 
API again. So, I'm going to ask it to 
fix that. It looks like it correctly 
identified that we needed to add a 
couple of fields to the database and 
it's created a new migration file here. 
And when you're working on a real 
application, you're always going to end 
up in the weeds on stuff like this where 
you're getting errors and you have to 
deal with the database. And if you don't 
understand software basics or how to use 
these tools, it can be hard to make 
progress. So, if you want to learn how 
to use these tools and how to build a 
real product, check out my AI coding for 
entrepreneurs course. It's on Skillap 
AI. There's a free trial and we go all 
the way from starting in Chad GPT with 
basic scripts, moving into lovable and 
building a landing page, and finally 
using cursor to build a full stack 
application. I think it's a great 
resource and a great way to get started 
on your AI coding journey. Now, to fix 
this issue, I'm going to run pnpm db 
push again. so that our database is 
updated and now we can see the habit 
here because our database is working 
properly. Now I'll go to the garden and 
we can actually select this and place it 
on the canvas. But I don't like how 
squished this looks. So what I'm going 
to do is actually use this new select 
element option and I'm going to select 
all of this and it's going to add it as 
context for cursor. That way I can 
describe the changes that I need 
specific to these UI elements. And I'll 
say let's keep the habit seeds at the 
top so that we can see the garden in 
full width at all times. Okay, there we 
go. That's looking pretty good. Let me 
go ahead and drag this. Doesn't look 
like it can drag. So, I'll add that as a 
to-do. But for now, I can click it and 
place it. I'll put it right there. 
Great. 
Now I see as I'm scrolling around it 
kind of zooms in and scrolls at the same 
time. So that's an issue I want to fix. 
And I'm just going to come up with these 
little edits and provide a list to 
cursor and it'll just work through all 
of them. I'll ask it to fix those couple 
of issues. And then I'm actually going 
to open a separate agent so that we can 
add the page to actually track these 
habits. I've described my feature and 
now I'm going to show you one other 
really powerful thing about cursor 2.0 
know, and that's the ability to run 
several agents in parallel. So, I'm 
going to go ahead and let's just start 
with two. We're going to have cursor 
implement this feature twice, and we'll 
be able to compare the different 
versions of it. So, we can choose which 
one to go with. This can greatly 
accelerate development, especially when 
you're doing something kind of creative 
and you want to see some different 
ideas. You can also choose different 
models to run in parallel. So let's say 
we want to run one with composer 1 and 
another one with sonnet 45. So we'll 
actually have three of them running. And 
let's go ahead and send it off. We can 
see that they're running in parallel. 
And when they need me to do something, 
there's a little icon there that will 
prompt me. Looks like the two composers 
are done and sonnet 45 is finishing up. 
Now, in terms of reviewing the results 
of these different agents, you can see 
all of the files that they've changed 
here and review them on the right. But 
seeing it update in the UI is a little 
bit more tricky. So, what you have to do 
is actually click this apply all button 
and that will apply the changes of this 
particular agent to your main branch. 
So, you can see it in your UI and your 
actually functioning software. So now 
I'm going to flip back over here and we 
see now that there's a whole calendar 
view. Now if I want to go check out the 
other branch, I'm going to undo apply 
and I'm going to go over there to the 
other one and click apply on that one. 
Now if I flip over, looks like this 
particular agent failed to import a 
particular item in here. So I can just 
abandon this branch and just go with the 
one that works. Just reviewing it again 
in the cursor browser and I'm pretty 
happy with how it looks. So I can check 
it is complete and we see it reflected 
in the calendar. I can drag and drop and 
that's a feature we added in the other 
agent that was running in parallel. So 
you can start to see how this is really 
becoming a full application. Now, if I 
come back to this later and I don't know 
what's going on, I can simply open up a 
new agent and just ask about how this 
works. So, here for example, I'll ask it 
how we track the habit streak and cursor 
is going to go read through all the 
files, come up with an answer. This is 
something I actually did recently in 
create volo app when I came back to the 
project 3 months after working on it and 
I wasn't sure how to deploy the new 
version of it. So I just asked cursor. 
It read through all my files and 
reminded me of the proper way to publish 
a new version of create volo app. I 
noticed that on this page it was saying 
zero days even though in the calendar it 
had an actual streak. So I asked it why 
that might be happening and cursor went 
through again a bunch of different files 
to figure out what was causing that 
problem. So you can see that it actually 
works in a real codebase. it can find 
the relevant files and get to the root 
cause of whatever issue you might have. 
It even proposed a solution for me. So, 
I'm going to switch this to agent mode 
and say, "Please implement this in my 
code." Now, when I refresh it, we see 
that it has an actual streak going. So, 
it's looking pretty good. So, everything 
we've looked at here is pretty much 
brand new cursor 2.0. You can always go 
back to the editor and see all of your 
files side by side. You can still use 
the new cursor browser inside here, 
which can be a really powerful way to 
also interact with the cursor agent. 
This is the more traditional view right 
in the editor. We see all of our files 
on the side here. Here we have the 
contents. We can see now the browser. We 
can see these plan files. And of course, 
we always have our chat on the right. 
So, you still have access to all of 
those original features, but it seems to 
me that the cursor 2.0 agent view is a 
really effective way to build software 
now that we're thinking about it more at 
the feature level instead of the 
individual file or individual function 
level. If you want to learn more about 
those traditional cursor features, make 
sure to check out this other related 
video which is going to go more into 
depth on that. Now, I also want to share 
a channel update, which is that I'm 
going to be shifting the format around a 
little bit. I realized that my videos 
are kind of scattered. There's 
tutorials, model reviews, multi-hour 
builds, stuff for beginners and experts, 
and I wanted to come up with a format 
that was going to take the best aspects 
of all those different types of videos 
and make something that would be more 
consistent, valuable, and teach you AI 
coding in the context of building real 
projects. So, moving forward, the 
channel is going to change around a 
little bit. Instead of having these sort 
of tool driven tutorials, I'm going to 
be building cool stuff, and that aligns 
more with what I want to be doing. 
Anyway, and in the process, I'll be 
showing you all the different AI tools I 
use, how I work through various 
problems, and you'll get to see me build 
something cool. I'm planning to kick 
this off with three videos released at 
the same time in the next few weeks, and 
that will be the beginning of a new 
chapter for the channel. So, I hope you 
enjoy the new videos, and thank you for 
your support. As always, thanks for 
watching. Take care.
