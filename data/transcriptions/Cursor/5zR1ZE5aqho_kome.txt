Hey guys, welcome to my cursor and coding with AI crash course. So in this video I'm going to introduce you to 
cursor and go over the features and interface, but I I'm also going to spend time talking about just coding with AI 
in general. So a lot of these practices and workflows and the stuff we talk about, they're going to apply whether 
you're working with cursor, claude code, winds surf, or any of these other tools. So we're going to talk about things like 
agents, rules, context, uh models, things like that. So, I want to give you 
kind of three different examples because there's different levels of of how much 
AI assistance you can use in your in your project. So, I want to start off doing what I would suggest beginners do, 
which is opening an existing project that you've been working on, open it in cursor, and then start to use it 
gradually. So, you can use things like tab completion and inline editing. And 
you can do that before you move to the the main chat interface where you just vibe code and pretty much just tell it 
what to do. So, we'll start off that way and we're going to use uh just an existing shopping cart UI that I have. 
And then we're going to move on to some vibe coding and we'll use the chat interface to create a a SAS landing page 
with an interactive calculator where you know you can change the number of users or the number of of any kind of resource 
and the price will update in real time. So we'll generate that. We'll go back and forth ask it questions talk about 
context. And then finally we're going to create a next.js project that will be a 
markdown resume editor. So something a little more in depth and we'll again 
talk about context. I'll show you how we can create a a context file. Uh we'll also talk about setting rules and so on. 
All right. So this will be kind of a it'll be longer than most cursor tutorials because I feel like a lot of 
them they just jump in and show you the chat interface and generate something and that's it. I want to go over the 
settings and and go over, like I said, the the kind of workflow that that I would use for each of these different um 
these different levels of of AI assistance. All right, so let's get into it. 
All right, guys. So, I just wanted to take a second and tell you about today's sponsor. So, Savella is an all-in-one 
solution for hosting your apps, your APIs, static sites, and they support 
just about any popular language and and framework that you can think of. And I myself have been doing web development 
for about 20 years now. And I remember the the absolute nightmare that came with deployment and DevOps up up until 
really just a few years ago. But Sabella is a platform that makes it super easy. Gives you a simple UI to work with to 
deploy your applications as well as spin up databases like Postgres in in really 
just a couple of clicks. And you can deploy from GitHub or GitLab or from a Docker image. They offer free static 
site hosting and then app and database hosting from $5 per month. And then 
obviously you can scale as needed. And I don't take on sponsors that I don't believe in. Sabella has a great service, 
great product. So check them out and the links in the description below. All right, so let's talk about what cursor 
actually is. So it's essentially a supercharged version of VS Code with AI built directly into the editor. So it's 
not just another extension that you add on top. The AI features are baked into the core experience and you get that 
familiar VS Code interface and you have, you know, powerful AI assistants that 
can help you write, edit, and understand code. And I would say the main difference between cursor and a lot of 
the other ai tools is how seamlessly integrated everything is. So instead of switching between your editor and a 
separate uh AI chat interface or dealing with clunky extensions, cursor just 
gives you multiple ways to interact with the AI right from where you're already working and it knows full context of 
your project. All right. So, I I want to talk a little bit about pricing because it can be pretty confusing and even 
Curser themselves admitted that their their roll out for pricing was horrible and it's changed over the past few 
months and it'll probably change again or I know it will change again. It's just a matter of when. So, by the time 
you watch this, this could be different. And I'll explain it to how I understand it because it still confuses me a little 
bit as well. And if if I'm wrong about anything, feel free to correct me. So, for the individual plans, you have the 
free tier, the hobby tier, you get a a two-eek trial of the pro tier, and you 
get very limited agent requests, which are basically interactions with the AI. So, whether that's in the chat interface 
or inline, you get very limited requests, limited tab completions. And 
then the $20 per month gives you extended limits on agent requests and uh unlimited tab completions. You also get 
something called background agents where you can run tasks in the background. Um access to bugbot which will look at your 
pull requests and and look for bugs and then access to maximum context windows. 
Now there's kind of a caveat from what I understand with the $20. So if you want 
to use a specific model because you can use multiple models with cursor whether it's GPT or claude or Gemini. If you 
want to use like let's say Claude for Sonnet and you want to only use that you 
you get allocated $20 per month towards that and if you go over that if you want 
to keep using that specific model then you'll be either be asked to upgrade to the 200 or you'll be asked if you want 
to pay the normal price for that model. Now, if you don't want to pay more than $20 per month, you don't have to, but 
you just switch to auto mode, which means that cursor selects the model that's going to be used based on 
basically based on the task that you're doing. Um, so that's kind of the caveat of this. You can't just use whatever 
model you want forever. Um, and then the $200 plan is is everything the $20 is. 
It's just more, right? You get 20 times the usage on these these premium models like GPT, Claude, Gemini, Grock. You can 
use pretty much anything, any of the real popular models. So, that's the pricing from what I understand. Now, to 
get Cursor, just go ahead and download it, install it just like anything. It'll ask you if you want to import your VS 
Code settings, and that includes your extensions. So, the interface is, you know, very, very familiar. So, let's 
open cursor up and I'm going to, like I said, I'm going to be using it in a project that already exists, which is 
this shopping cart UI. And before I get into anything any of the code, I just want to talk about the settings and the 
interface. So, the biggest the most notable change here between VS Code and 
Cursor is going to be this chat interface on the right. And this is where you're going to spend a lot of 
time if you're using AI a lot, if you're basically vibe coding. So from here you 
can add context, right? Context is just is basically what the AI sees and it 
does see your entire project without having to add context. But if you wanted to focus on specific functions or a 
specific problem, you know, uh lines or whatever, then you can add right here 
you can add certain you know files and folders code documentation. So like uh 
if you wanted to add let's say the font awesome docs or something like that or git repositories pass chat rules which 
I'll talk about in a few minutes terminals your active tabs so if I open a tab that's automatically going to be 
in my context you can see right here one tab and you can also specify with at so 
let's say I wanted to add like um index CSS or or whatever I could add it that 
way. All right. So, just be aware of what is in your immediate context. Now, 
this stuff, agent auto, I'm going to talk about that in a minute, but I want to get into the settings. So, let's go 
to cursor settings and then cursor settings. So, from here in the general tab, you have your manage account. This 
is where you can see all your usage, the exact models that you use, the tokens, all that stuff. And then this is just 
basic settings. Privacy mode. So if you have this on, which I do, your data 
won't be trained on or used to improve the product. So that's that's up to you if you want to keep it on or off. I just 
I value my privacy, so I keep it on. And then the chat tab here. So this is where 
you can choose the default mode of agent or ask. Now, I would say at least 95% of 
the time you're going to be in agent mode because the agent is what actually uh creates files, edits your code, um 
runs terminal commands, runs tests. So, it does it does all that stuff. It's 
like the the virtual coder where ask mode is more like a chatbot like chat 
GPT or Claude AI. So if you want to ask specific questions either about the project or about something else like 
maybe you want to know more about the use ref hook from React or something like that then you would use ask. So 
you're most likely not going to have the default as ask. But if you want to use it you can go here in the chat interface 
and you can select ask. Okay. And you might also want to use this if you want to ask a question but not worry about it 
actually editing your code because sometimes the agent will edit stuff that you don't want to. It'll run code. It'll 
um you know run tasks that you don't want. And you can also uh use background agents from here as well. So yeah, all 
this stuff is pretty basic. The include full folder folder context. 
I wouldn't suggest adding that because that can it can add to your tokens. It can slow things down. Um web search 
tools. So you want to allow agents to search the web for relevant information. I would suggest leaving that on. So, 
let's see. Auto run mode, also known as YOLO, uh, YOLO mode, will just run tools 
like command line tools and stuff without asking or needing your permission. So, I would say leave this 
at ask every time if you're just getting started with cursor. And then once you get a feel for it, once you get add some 
rules, then you can just have it run everything automatically if you want. There's also an allow list. Okay, so 
tab, this just has to do with tab completions. There's partial accepts. So if you want to accept a part of a 
suggestion, you can do that with command or control arrow. Now models, this is where your models are enabled or 
disabled. So I pretty much have the defaults. I've uh GPT5, Claude 4 Sonnet, Claude 3.7, Cursor 
small, which is Cursor's own model. Um that's pretty much all I have enabled, but you also have like 03, you have 
Gemini, you have Grock. Uh yeah. So if you want to enable other models here you 
can. Now claw 4 opus is for it. You can use that with cursor but only in max 
mode. So max mode will get maximum context window in tool calls. And this 
can again really just just raise your token your usage. Um it can also really 
slow things down. So I would only use this if you're doing really difficult stuff like difficult calculations or 
whatever. So otherwise I would I would suggest keeping that off. So background 
agents I haven't really gotten into. Um MCP tools. So basically model model 
context protocol servers you can add those here. Um basically like let's say 
Neon database or or or Kubernetes or Firebase. These these services have 
these MCP servers that you can use to basically directly interact with the AI 
kind of like kind of like an API. And then rules and memories. Rules are really important when it comes to coding 
with AI because if you don't have rules then it's just going to do things however it wants. So here you have both 
user rules and you also have project rules. So user rules are global that pertains to any project where project 
rules obviously pertain to that specific project and stuff that is is directly 
related to specific technologies like React or or Python whatever it is you're 
using usually that's going to go in your project rules and then more general stuff more highlevel rules will go in 
your user rules. So you can see mine. We'll just look at these for instance. Prioritize clean, efficient, and 
maintainable code. Follow best practices and design patterns. Generate concise, actionable responses. Some of these are 
are kind of redundant, but I think that they're important. So uh most of them are are pretty general, but some are 
related to technologies like I have used TypeScript over JavaScript for any React 
or Nex.js projects. Um, and and some of this stuff you'll add as you go along 
and you notice that it's doing things you don't want or that you want to change. For instance, anytime I would 
generate a Nex.js project and use Tailwind, it was using Tailwind 3 and it 
was creating a config file. So, I specifically said always use Tailwind 4 syntax and refer to the docs for version 
4. Never use version three. Another thing it was doing was suppressing my TypeScript errors. So I said do not 
ignore suppressed TypeScript errors. Focus on clean passing code. I said never use the any type unless absolutely 
necessary. So I mean you know rigorous rigorously apply dry and kiss principles 
in all code. So most of it's pretty high level but rules are are very important. 
Now when you create a project rule it creates it in your uh in your file structure. It'll be a folder called I 
believe curse.cursor cursor and then a rules folder. It used to be a single file called cursor rules, but that's 
been deprecated, but you can still use that. It still works. And then indexing. 
This just shows that 100% of my codebase is indexed. Um, so basically it sees your whole codebase, but again add the 
context if you want to focus on something specific and your open tabs will be in your context. So no need to 
add those manually. All right. So that's kind of just the the gist of of every everything and how it works. So now what 
I want to do is give you a couple different examples. I'm going to start with just using cursor with an existing 
project. So let's start that. All right. So as I mentioned, there's different levels of of AI assistance that you can 
use in your projects. Anything from using it to write every line of code to 
you just using a little bit of tab completion, using it to ask questions and learn. And that's the way I would 
suggest using it if you're a beginner, not just a beginner to to programming in general, but to a specific language or 
framework or or anything you're using. So that's what I want to show you first is to use it in an existing application. 
So I have this shopping cart UI and this is just a very simple project from my React course. It's not an e-commerce 
platform or anything. It's just some products that you can add to your cart. And I I basically used it to show how to 
use the context API because as you can see there's a context and there's an add to cart function in that context. And 
what I want to use tab completion to do is to make it so we have a quantity 
selector that will pass a quantity in here instead of just adding one to it, which is what it's currently doing. So 
let's run the project. I'm going to open up my terminal. It uses JSON server. So, I'm going to say run JSON- 
server. And then I'll open up another tab 
and let's do npm npm rundev. 
And then I'll open that up. Okay. So, this is what it looks like. We just have some cards with some products. 
This is the cart right here. And if I click add to cart, gets added. And I can click multiple times and add multiple 
quantities. But like I said, I want to have a a a quantity selector. Basically, a button to to increase or decrease the 
quantity. All right. So, let's do that. I'm going to jump over to components product card. And I'm just going to put 
my my cursor here. And you can see it's recommending use state import use state. 
It's also recommending to add uh the quantity as a state, which is what I 
want to do. So, I'm going to hit tab. It'll accept both of those. Now, it's going to keep going. So you see this tab 
to next move. So I can either hit it or I can scroll down and I'll still see I'll see right here tab to jump here. So 
I'll do that. And then the recommendation is to pass the quantity into the function. So I'll accept that. 
All right. Now there's no quantity buttons here. So I'm going to click above the add to cart button and it 
should suggest. So it's suggesting an opening div. I'll go ahead and accept that. Now it's accepting or sorry it's 
suggesting a button with an on click to set the quantity to to minus whatever it 
is. So the decrease button I'll accept that. Then it's suggesting the span 
which is going to show the quantity and the the button to add to the quantity. So I'll accept that. Now it's showing 
the closing button and the closing div. So I'll click that tab to wrap it up. And now we should see the buttons. So, 
I'll go ahead and go to the the browser here. And now we have these quantity 
buttons. All right. And I didn't write one line of code. Now, these aren't going to work just yet. If I have it to 
three and I hit add to cart, you'll see it's only one. That's because this add 
to cart, even though, you know, we're passing a quantity in, it doesn't accept that. So, what I want to do is go to 
that function, which is in this, it's in the context coming from use cart. So, 
I'm going to commandclick that. go to that file. And now notice it says tab to next move. So if I come up here, it says 
tab to jump here. So not only does the tab follow me, you know, through the file going to different lines, but it 
follows me across multiple files. So I'll hit tab. And now it suggesting that I add the quantity. I'll accept it. Now 
right here, another one's popping up. And you can't see that, but it says tab or whatever. It says tab to to go here. 
I'm going to do that. And what it's going to do is get rid of that one. And it's going to use that quantity that's 
passed in. Okay. So now I'll save that. We'll go back to the project. I'm just 
going to clear the cart and I'm going to select three of the headphones. Add to cart. And now you'll see three times 
$59.99. Okay. So we now added that functionality. And I didn't write any 
code, but I did see exactly what it did. So this this way of using AI is much 
different than just saying, you know, add the add the quantity buttons. I mean, you could do that and then look at 
the file, but this shows you everything. So now I want to show you the inline edit, which is also very helpful. So 
let's say now that we added those buttons, we don't like the look of them, right? So let me just make this a little 
smaller. So we don't like the look of them. So I'm going to select the div 
that wraps those buttons. Right? So I want to select this whole div and the two buttons and the quantity display. 
And then I'm going to hit you can either click this quickedit or command or control K. And then this input is going 
to pop up and I'm going to say can you style the or can you style um this area 
better? And then you have options. You have edit selection, so that's whatever's highlighted. You have edit 
full file if you wanted to look at the full file. Quick question, so if you just had a quick question, which is 
which is great for learning, and then send to chat, which is just going to put what whatever you put here is going to 
go to the chat. So I want edit selection. And I'll hit enter or click send. So it says generating now. It's 
going to make the changes and give me the diff. So anything that is gone that 
it gets rid of is in red. Anything it adds is in green. So you can see it added the class of justify center gap 
three and margin top four. And then it added a bunch of classes onto the button. Now you can if you don't want 
this the suggestion or the change, you can just hit undo or you can hit keep to 
keep it. Usually there's a keep all button so you don't have to go through and click all these. Okay. Now let's 
save it. Let's go back. And now you can see that it's styled differently. It's in the middle. It has rounded buttons. 
Okay, just make sure it still works, which it does. It added three. So, that's inline editing. Now, let's uh 
let's use inline editing for some other things. I'm just I'm not going to make any selection. And I'm going to hit 
command K. And then uh I don't want a selection. 
So, let's just go like right here and command K. All right. All right. So, 
it's just it's saying edit selection no matter what. But what I want to do is edit full file. Okay. And then I'm going 
to say can you uh can you add we'll say area 
attributes to the elements 
in this file. Okay. Okay. So now it's going to select the whole file and look at it. 
And there we go. So it shows me the difference, right? So what in red is 
what it gets rid of, green, it's what it adds. I'll click accept. And then it it accepts all of those. I don't have to go 
through and hit keep. So now if we take a look, we have like area described by, 
we have uh let's see, Arya label. So it went ahead and added those accessibility 
attributes. So let's say we want to add another piece of state. Let's do a hover. So a card hover. So I'll hit um 
enter. Put my cursor here. Actually this is this is suggesting an is added which 
we could do this. So basically it'll say added to cart if we clicked if we 
clicked on the add to cart. So I'll go ahead and accept that. And then it says tab to next move right here. Going to 
hit that tab. And then it's going to add a set is added to true. Okay, so this 
popup is what it it'll it'll add if I hit tab again, which I'm going to. And then it says tab to next move again. 
Brings me down here and shows me that it's going to add a turnary and show added to cart if that is added is true. 
So I'll hit tab to accept that. Okay, let's save it. Let's go back here. Let's click add to cart. And now it says added 
to cart. So now I want to add a hover effect. And I could do that in in a 
bunch of different ways. I could use inline editing. I could just use tab completion, but let's use the the chat 
interface. So I'll say um and this this is in context. You can see right here 
one tab. So my product card file is in the context. So, I'm going to say, can 
you can you make it so there is a we'll just say an effect 
uh an effect on the cards 
when hovering. Okay, so this is similar to using inline 
edit. So, it should show me the the diff. 
So it shows me which cut which um file it's working on. So product card 
it's applying and now it shows the diff. And then there's a keep all button. So I'm going to hit that and then let's 
save it. And also it gives you a summary of what it did. So card container 
enhance shadow on hover. It shows me exactly what it did. So pay attention to that. Don't just randomly add stuff and 
and let it do all the work. learn from it as you're doing it. So now if I hover over these cards, then I get that that 
zoom effect. Okay, so those are the different ways that you can use AI to enhance your your 
coding experience, but you can still, you know, still know what you're doing. And another great way to use it is to 
just ask questions. So, for instance, if I want to go to the context and let's 
just grab the um the add to cart. Actually, let's we'll we'll take the 
whole provider. So, I'll take the provider here 
and I'm going to say quickedit or or command K and I'll say can you 
can you explain what this provider 
function does. Okay. And then I'm going to select I'll just keep edit selection or not edit. 
Sorry, I don't want to edit selection. I'm not editing anything. It's a quick question. 
So it'll answer me right here. So the cart provider function creates a React context provider for a shopping cart, 
initializes the cart from local storage, persists cart changes, provides functions. All right. Okay. And then I 
can keep I can add a followup and keep asking it if if it's not clear. And then I could do the same thing over here in 
the chat interface. So you can do it in in either area. All right. So that's pretty much what I wanted to show you 
with an existing project. So now let's jump in and do some some higher level stuff and a little bit of vibe coding. 
All right. So we looked at how to kind of gradually use AI in cursor into an 
existing project. Now we're going to do something more highlevel and do some vibe coding. And it's going to be 
something really simple, a SAS landing page with uh an interactive calculator. 
And we're just going to kind of oneshot it. If this were a more in-depth project, then I would do a lot more 
planning. Um I think that since we don't have to like write boilerplate and and a lot of time is freed up now with AI, if 
you if you're using it, then put that that energy into planning, into structuring everything out, you know, 
your database models, your layout. So you want to really kind of up your your 
project management skills. But let's go ahead and just put we're this is really simple. So we'll say create 
uh create a say landing page 
for a SAS product with an interactive 
calculator. And let's say add a hero section 
features testimonials 
and say add a pricing uh pricing slider 
that updates costs. and we'll say based on based on number 
of users and other resources and I'll say use CSS animations 
um what else create or we'll say make it responsive 
responsive with a simple hamburger menu 
I notice that sometimes it over complic complicates just like hamburger menus and it over complicates vanilla 
JavaScript a lot in my experience. So, I'm going to say um keep we'll say keep 
the the JS very simple, clean, 
and readable. And I'm going to specifically say do do 
not uh overengineer 
Okay. Um, what else do I want to put? I'm going to say use use only 
HTML and I'm going to say plain CSS because it will it might use Tailwind if 
I don't and vanilla JS. 
And I think that's it. Yeah. So, let's try that out. Very basic prompt. Uh 
again, if it were a more serious project, I might put that through chat GBT or Claude AI first and then have it 
create uh something that's more, you know, better formatted and just more in-depth. But this is something very 
simple and and I don't want this video to be, you know, three hours long. All right, so let's see what we got 
here. I'm just going to open it up first and take a look. So I'm using live server. So cloud scale, scale your 
business to the cloud. Got some cool little animations here. API, DB, AI. So, 
it looks like a legit SAS landing page. Why choose Cloud Scale? I like that. I 
like these effects. So, those are the features. We get the calculator that I 
asked for. All right. So, very simple, but I think it's clean. I think it looks nice. I mean, I might like decrease the 
spacing here and do some small little adjustments, but I'm not going to do that in this video. Uh, let's test the 
the calculator. So, we got number of users. As I scale that up, you'll see the price goes up. Storage, bandwidth. 
So, that will all cause the price price to go up. Now, I'd like to have a toggle here so that it would show maybe a 
savings if you were to pay annually versus monthly. So, that's maybe that's something we can ask for. Uh, let's see. 
Get started. That has a cool effect when I click it. So, let's um let's check let's check 
mobile. So, we got Okay, that's that's fine. 
Little hamburger menu and everything stacks. 
So, yeah, this actually looks really good. I've generated quite a few things like this and this is one of the better 
ones. So, let's um yeah, let's let's ask for it to add the annual option on the 
calculator. So, I'm going to go back to cursor and we're just going to keep all here. 
And let's say, can you add a toggle switch 
on the calculator that will display 
monthly versus yearly pricing? 
And let's save them let's say 20 uh 20% 
if if they pay excuse me yearly. 
And while it's doing that let's just take a look here. So the index the the HTML is usually pretty good with this um 
using you know semantic tags and all that. So pretty simple pretty straightforward. The CSS 
again just got a reset. We got our containers typography. I would have liked to have the colors in in in custom 
properties. That's something we could ask for, but uh at first glance just 
looks looks fine. And script.js. So we get our DOM content loaded. We have a 
function that initializes these functions, the hamburger menu, the pricing calculator, and so on. 
Um, this just toggles the the active class on the on the menu. 
Close the menu when clicking on the nav links. Close menu when clicking outside. 
We got our pricing calculator initialization. So, it's just grabbing all the DOM elements and putting them 
into variables. We have our rates object. 
Looks like it just added some stuff here. So, anything in the green it just added. Um, just going to keep all. So, 
we get our rates object. So, you can easily change this if you want, you know, more than $5 per user or per 
storage, whatever. Update pricing. So, this will do the calculation and then 
update that pricing based on that. So, looks like it just added this stuff, 
the is yearly, because I just asked for that. We'll check that in a minute. animate value. 
So, scrolling animations just kind of adds and removes classes. We got an 
inter uh uh intersection observer smooth scrolling 
create ripple. So, that's that effect that get started had um as a ripple effect. 
Yeah. So, some of this is probably overkill with the animations. But uh overall I think it it it looks 
all right. But let's check that switch. So we got monthly. It's at 85 right now. If I hit 
yearly, wait. Yeah, monthly 85. Yearly 
it would be 816. But I'd like to see the monthly rate if I pay yearly. Does it show me 
that? Well, it shows the yearly savings, I guess. Um, yeah, I'd like to show the month. 
So, let's go back here and let's say, can you also show 
what what the monthly 
price will be if paid 
uh annually? See what that does. 
Okay, so let's check that out. So, let's see. We got monthly 85. If I hit 
yearly, so now it shows me the effective monthly cost would be 68 versus 85. All right, 
perfect. So, yeah, this looks pretty good. There's not much I'd change in terms of 
of the design. So, a lot of times what I'll do is um is 
have a change document that will just update as I make changes. So why don't 
we do that? Let's say can you can you create a changes I'll call it 
changes.md file that will 
that will track we'll say track any um major 
major changes and features features that we make 
and add the changes that we already made. 
All right. So, looks like it added the changes file. So, uh let's see core 
features implemented hero section navigation and mobile menu. So it looks 
like just the initial features that it added modern CSS animations and then 
here new features added monthly verse yearly billing toggles. So it's good it 
log that the yearly pricing with 20% discount enhanced pricing UI 
technical improvements. Okay, so this should keep going as you work and it's nice to just have a a 
place where you can see everything that's been changed since your initial generation. Uh, and of course, you know, 
you're using git and so on, but this is it's nice to have just a single file as well. So yeah, that's really all I 
wanted to do is just give you guys an example of generating something and talk a little bit about the workflow. And we 
could even do an uh Lighthouse report and see what kind of scores we get for performance and uh what else? 
Accessibility. I think it does SEO. 
All right. So pretty good scores. 91 performance, 92, 96 for best practices. 
SEO is 90. I mean, we could try to improve them a little bit. You could actually take a screenshot maybe of this 
stuff right here and uh and you could put that in the context. That's another thing you can do is you can actually 
load images in here. Uh you could even put an image of a layout and ask it to to to replicate it with HTML, CSS, 
JavaScript, whatever. But yeah, I think that I'm going to stop here as far as this project goes and then we'll jump 
into uh we'll jump into creating a Nex.js application. So last thing I want 
to do is generate a Nex.js JS project and we're going to do something simple cuz I'm you know trying to fit all this 
in one video and we're going to create a simple split uh split view resumeé 
editor where we have a form on one side to add our information add our our experience and then create a markdown 
resume on the other side and if we have time we'll add like PDF export but for 
for now it's going to be pretty simple and what I'll usually do for a larger project is create this project d-context 
text MD file and just put in basically my my vision of the project. And this 
one is very simple. Usually it'll be a lot more than this, but this is a really simple project. So I'll put the goal. So 
build a clean split screen resume editor with live preview. The text stack is next TypeScript and Tailwind React 
Markdown for preview and local storage for persistence. Then we have some quick rules. So use TypeScript interfaces for 
all data client components for forms and server components for display arrow functions. Keep it simple and focused. 
Have a modern look. Ask to manually test code after each feature. And then I just 
um you know mapped out the the resume data type which will be name, email, phone, summary, experience with some 
other fields and then skills. So uh the layout structure left side 
will be the form right side will be the preview split 50/50 clean professional styling and then key features real-time 
preview updates clean form with proper spacing etc. So I'm not going to put 
this in the prompt. What I do is put this in the root and then in the prompt I'll tell it to look at this in the 
context. So let's uh let's go ahead and open up cursor 
and I have an empty folder called markdown editor and then what I'm going to do is is generate a new nex.js 
project using create next app. Now you could go up here and say create me a 
nextjs project with tailwind 4. But when I do that it seems to have get something wrong. When you do it yourself you have 
no margin of error. You know exactly what you're getting. So I would always suggest just gener generating the boiler 
plate on your own. So I'll say npx and then let's say create next- app and 
let's do at latest and then dot because we want it in this directory. And I'm going to say yes to all this 
eslint typescript tailwind um source directory app router turboac and no to 
the import alias changing that. Okay. Okay. And then while that's going 
on, I'm going to take my project context that I just showed you and move that over to the root. 
All right. And then I also have rules that I use for Nex.js and TypeScript. So 
this is just, you know, best practices, app router patterns, um, React 19 
optimization. So it doesn't use use memory or use callback because the compiler does that. Um, component 
architecture, data fetching patterns. It's just a standard file. Um, and you can go to cursor.directory. And there's 
tons of rules for TypeScript and and next. But I'll just go ahead and um, how 
do I want to do this? I guess I'll just copy this. And then I'm going to go to 
uh, file. Let's see. Not file. Cursor settings. Cursor settings. We'll go to 
our rules. And this is these are going to be project rules. So right here, I could say add rule. And I'll call this t 
uh ts- next. And then you can apply it manually, 
meaning you tell you prompt and you tell it to use it, or you can do apply to specific files or always apply. I like 
to do apply intelligently, which lets the agent decide when it's relevant. So we'll do that. And then I'm just going 
to go ahead and paste in uh what I just showed you. All right. So I'll save that. And now we 
have those rules. and it's going to create this dot dot cursor folder and a rules folder inside of it with that file 
which has an MDC extension. Okay, so now that we have the context, we have the rules, we have the Nex.js 
boilerplate, we'll go ahead and run the server. So, npm rundev. And this is just my way of doing it. 
There's a million ways to do it. You might find uh a different way, you know, something you like better, but 
everything in this video is pretty much just how I like to do it. And obviously I'm pretty new to it. I mean, everyone 
is really. So, we got the Next.js boilerplate up and running. Now what 
I'll do is come over to the prompt and I'll say uh take a look take a look at 
and then we can use the at symbol and then project context file and I'll say 
let me know if you we'll say if you understand 
the instructions or something like that. You can phrase 
it however you want. So it gives me the project overview, key requirements, technical guidelines. So sometimes this 
is easier than than writing the prompt. Oh, you just create your context, you tell it to look at it, and then you go 
from there. So I'm ready to start building this resume editor. Should I begin by examining the current project 
structure and then implementing the core components? I'll make sure to use Tailwind 4. So I'm going to say I 
probably should have put this in the context. I thought I did, but I'll say I already I already generated 
the app with Tailwind 4. So, no need. Let's Let's 
start to build out the layout and 
components. Okay. So, it's going to examine the 
current project, which is just a, you know, boilerplate. All right. So, let's see. So, it's going 
to install React Markdown, create the resumeé interface, build the split view layout, create the form components, and 
create the preview component. So, that sounds like a good plan. Let's go ahead and run the React Markdown install. 
Now, let me create the core components. First, I'll create the RSé interface and types. So, it's going to create the 
TypeScript file. If we take a look at that, we have a ré type with these fields. experience will be an array of 
experiences. So this type here you get res uh resume form data. So I'll just 
say keep all to that. And you don't have to approve them like see the check mark. I can I can reject 
the changes or I can hit the check mark. But even if you don't hit the check mark, it's still going to approve it. 
So now let me create the components directory and the resume form component. and you can like you know check things 
out as it's as it's building it. So this will be a client component because it's going to use hooks. You can't use hooks 
in in server components. And let's see got our state for the form 
data. A use effect to check if it's in local storage. 
Save data to local storage when when the form changes. Update your experience. So we should be 
able to add multiple experiences. Here's the form, the function to do 
that. You'll be able to remove an experience, update your skills, 
personal information. So, pretty simple stuff. 
And you're going to see errors and and and it's going to stop working. Like, it's probably broken right now. Well, no, it's not. But you'll see errors and 
stuff because it's in the middle of creating files. A file might be half created. So, if you try to load it, 
you're going to see an error. Just make sure that you wait until everything is done before you actually try it out and 
test it because it's, you know, it's still going now. So, I'm not going to test it yet. 
But, I mean, this doesn't look bad. You know, we got our split view, which we asked for. We get the live preview. 
Hopefully, that works. Got the form. We got uh an experience. So, little module 
to add experience. Add skill. 
Now I have it so it'll run npm run build very frequently because I don't want it 
to I don't want to have any weird TypeScript errors. I don't want to have linting errors. I don't want to suppress 
them. So I just want to make sure everything is nice and clean. 
Make sure it all passes. So it looks like there's got a small issue. 
So it'll it'll automatically try to fix those issues. And now it looks like it passed. So the build is successful with 
a minor eslint warning. Let me fix that quickly. 
And it's going to check again. So it'll fix it or try to fix it and then check it again to verify it. 
Okay. So let's see. Resume editor complete. So it basically created our 
what we've asked for so far. We got the live preview, the form components, the split view, the um local storage, modern 
UI. So, let's test it out. Come over here and just going to Whoops. So, this 
will happen often, this internal server error, just because things are happening so fast, and sometimes you just need to 
uh to refresh the server. So, that's what I'm going to do. 
And then once it refreshes, you should have no issues. It should just reload. 
Sometimes it takes a second. All right. So, let's say John. And you 
can see that as I type, it's giving me a live preview. I should probably put my full name or or a full name. John Doe. 
Let's say Johngmail.com 
555. So, the the text in the input is super light. I can't even see it. So, we'll 
have to fix that. Uh, actually, you know what? I have a form filler. I'm just going to use that. So, I'm going to go 
ahead and just fill these out. So, and it added an experience. I know you can't really see that here. Um, now if I want 
to add another experience, I can click that and it has another box. So, I'll fill that out. Now, I have two 
experiences. And then skills. Looks like it's going to be just commaepparated values. Again, 
I know you can't really see the inputs, but let's see if I do JS and then PHP. 
Oh, wait. No, it's not. I'm sorry. It's not commaepparated. We have a skill button here. So, I'll say JavaScript 
add skill. All right. So, this is cool. So, we got PHP add skill 
um I don't know CSS. Cool. And we can delete them. So, if I click the delete, that goes away. If I 
click the remove on the job experience, that goes away. But let's add a couple. 
Let's add it back just to have something. Okay. And then it should stay. If I 
refresh the page, it stays because remember it gets saved to local storage. In fact, we can check make sure check 
that. So, local storage and you can see resumeé data. So, all of our data is 
getting saved. Now, this obviously doesn't look very good. I mean, you're not going to go 
apply to a job with this, but it gives you an idea of how this works. Right now, I do want to make the text so we 
can actually see it in the form. So, I'll I'll just say that the form input 
text is I'll say way too light. 
Please darken. And that's something that's really 
simple. So, that should just should be pretty quick. 
Yep, there we go. So now this is docker. 
Yep, this one summary looks good. 
So I mean you can imagine you could you could make this you could add a ton of features to this. So so you can add 
multiple résumés um obviously PDF export maybe send to employer or something like 
that. that you can have authentication with with Google login, GitHub login, 
maybe even have premium features and and charge people for those extra features. 
So, why don't we try one more thing? Why don't we try adding a PDF export? So, I'm going to say add a PDF export for 
the resume. And it'll probably use a package like um JSPDF, I guess. 
HTML2 canvas. Not sure if I've used those. 
So now we have a utils folder with PDF export.ts. So we're using those two packages. We 
have our export. Looks like this is all the styling for the PDF. 
Adding it to the canvas. So we'll see how it looks. It might look 
like crap to begin with, but you got to, you know, work through it. Um, the symptom tracker that I'm creating, it it 
generates health reports, and it took me a long time. It took me like like three 
or four hours to get the the PDF looking decent. It just looked horrible at first. That's what happens with a lot of 
these packages. You really got to tweak them. So, now it's going to run npm run build. 
And I know it's still working, but I'm just going to see. So, we do have the export PDF now. I don't want to try it 
though until this is completely done. Okay, so feature has been added. We're 
probably going to get yep, internal server error. So, that's no problem. Just uh just restart the server. 
So, it says the export button will now appear on the top right. Generate professional PDFs. 
So, let's try that out. I'm going to refresh this. 
All right. So, we got this Michelle uh Jacobson get some experience. Excuse me. 
Let's export. So, we got the download. Let's open the PDF. 
And there we go. Actually, it looks the exact same really. I mean, there's some text over here, so you might have to mess with that. um probably within that 
excuse me within that utility file but uh but the you know PDF export works 
perfectly. So you just work at it you know you just keep going and just keep asking 
questions try to get a feel of the code and try not to just let it snowball like 
I mentioned before and and you know get all this technical debt um you want to kind of understand what's going on. So 
that's it guys. Hopefully you enjoyed this and and learned something from it, even if it's just a little bit of, you 
know, how to use your how to create a workflow when you're using AI. Um, all it obviously I will do some some 
vibecoded projects, but obviously that's not going to be the main focus. The main focus of the channel is always to to 
teach people how to code. So that's it for now. Thanks for watching and I'll see you next
