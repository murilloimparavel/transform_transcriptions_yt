Let’s cover 10 pro tips for working with the 
Cursor agent. So, I’ve got Cursor open and my   
agent on the right. And the first tip is to use 
Plan Mode. So, in the agent input, I’m going to   
hit Command N to make a new chat. And then I can 
hit Shift Tab to switch and toggle into Plan Mode.   
Now, what Plan Mode can do is it can actually 
go look at my codebase, research and understand   
how my app is set up, and then help me create a 
high-quality plan to implement a feature. So, this   
is on my personal website. I’m going to say let’s 
make a new page to show my top artists on Spotify   
and I’m going to hit Enter. Now, I’ve already set 
up Spotify in my app and I’m using it to display   
the track that I last listened to on my homepage. 
So, we’re going to see that it’s planning the   
next moves here and it’s going to come back to 
us with a few questions to help clarify what   
the implementation’s going to look like. So, 
it reads my current Spotify implementation.   
It reads some of the code that I’ve already set 
up and it’s going to help me figure out how I   
would actually add this feature. So, let’s do, 
uh, slash, we’ll do slash music and then we’re   
going to do, let’s do top 10. Yeah, top 10 works. 
Time range, um, let’s do all time and last three   
months. Two buckets, sure. And then for displaying 
what we want to show, we can do, um, use your best   
judgment. I’m just going to see what the model 
comes up with and we can change it and tweak it   
from there. So, it’s starting to make the plan 
and we see as it’s making the plan, it creates   
a new Markdown file and it’s giving some details 
on what needs to be created. It’s calling specific   
components and files and referencing them in our 
application. And it even makes some to-dos that we   
can use to implement the feature. So, this seems 
fine. We can just read through here. It looks   
okay. If I wanted to make any changes, I could go 
in here and say, um, we don’t need a brief intro   
about music taste. So, we can get rid of that. 
I’ll save the plan. The to-dos seem fine. Okay.   
So, now if this looks good and we’re happy with 
it, we can hit Build. And Build is going to accept   
this plan. And then for our given model, which I’m 
using Claude 4.5 Sonnet here, it’s going to go and   
actually implement the plan. So, let’s let this 
cook. Okay, so the model finished, but it actually   
didn’t work. I tried to load the page and I got a 
permissions error. So, I needed to reauthorize my   
Spotify token to have the additional permissions. 
So, I just pasted in the error I saw and now it   
works. So, if I go back to my app, I now have this 
list of my top artists. So, thank you Plan Mode. 
The second pro tip I want to show is accessing 
the context menu and specifically a feature at   
branch. So, I’m going to go ahead and Command 
Shift P, create branch, and we’ll call this   
top-artists. And then inside of our chat window, 
I’m going to make a new chat. And in this new chat   
if you type the @ symbol. So, let’s just do that. 
What you get is this menu with all these different   
options. And one of them is get and specifically 
at branch. So, on this branch, what I want to do   
is review all of the changes and see if there 
are any issues. So, I’ll kick that off. Now,   
inside of that menu, there’s actually a lot 
of stuff. I can just pull it up here. We have   
files and folders. You can reference public 
documentation, past chats, linter errors, uh,   
all sorts of different things, especially 
tagging in specific files or folders that   
will go into the context. So, if you know, for 
example, you’re going to use this Spotify file,   
you can tag that into the context and put it in 
the context window for working with an agent. So,   
I find these get commands pretty helpful. 
And it looks like the code seems pretty good.   
We’re having the AI review the AI-generated code, 
but maybe there’s one issue with the cache times   
that are different. Nice. Okay, so overall 
seems pretty good. That was pretty helpful. 
The third pro tip I want to show is creating 
custom commands. So, in the Cursor folder,   
inside of here, I’m going to make a new folder 
and we’re going to call it commands. And inside   
of here, I can add in Markdown files as commands. 
So, we’re going to call this one PR. And inside   
of here, I can call this file whatever I want. 
I can put whatever prompt I want in here. So,   
we’re going to use this to make PRs. So, uh, 
your job is to create a PR with a descriptive   
title. Always use the GitHub CLI. Now, we could 
add in specific rules or specific guidelines,   
commit guidelines in here as well, but, um, let’s 
also say if you haven’t already made a commit,   
do that first. Great. So, we have this command. 
Now, over here in the agent panel, I can do   
slash and it’s going to show up as an option 
as a custom command I can run. So, slash PR,   
and we even see this little hover of what the 
custom prompt here is. So, slash PR. Let’s run   
that and see what happens. Now, my hope here is it 
will use a shell command to use the GitHub CLI to   
go ahead and first make a commit and then make a 
PR. So, it’s going to check and get status here.   
Great. We have some, if I go over to my source 
control view, got some stuff on this branch,   
uh, and some changes that we need to commit. So, 
it’s going to go ahead and look at the changes,   
try to figure out what the PR is about, 
and then make this change for us.   
Okay, so this just finished and I see I 
have a link to my new pull request. Nice. 
The fourth agent pro tip is that you can pass 
images to the agent. So, we have our list of   
top artists, but maybe we want it to look more 
like the Spotify Wrapped. So, let’s copy this   
image. We can go back to here and paste it in 
so we can see what the image looks like here.   
And we’re going to say make the top artists 
and music page look closer to the image with   
artist photos please. Now, this is not scientific, 
but I think if you add please and thank you, the   
models perform better. You are burning more energy 
in the data centers, so, you know, there are some   
trade-offs here, but we’re going to see if please 
and thank you help us get a better response. So,   
it’s going to go and make some changes to our 
Spotify code to how it’s fetching the data for   
the artist. So, we need to get the images as well. 
And then it’s also going to update the top artist,   
so this component that displays each kind of 
element in the list. That makes sense. So,   
it’s kind of cooking away here. And it probably 
also needs to update the configuration to handle   
these images from a remote URL. So, 
we’ve got the Spotify images here. So,   
it’s going to go and update that. That seems 
right. Next config, uh, okay. I’ll keep that.   
Seems good. And I think that’s everything. 
Let’s go check it out. Uh, reload the page.   
Okay. So, it was very honest to the image 
where it’s got these big numbers kind of   
like the Wrapped and we do have images. Um, 
so, that’s not bad actually. Um, yeah. Yeah,   
I can now tweak it from here if I want to make 
it look even better, but it’s a good start. 
The fifth agent pro tip is that you 
can fork or duplicate chats. So,   
let’s say I like what I have here, but I 
want to try a couple different options.   
I can keep all of the context I have so far 
and I can click on this dot dot dot and go to   
duplicate chat and then make some changes 
from here. That’s one option. In general,   
I try to recommend using the smallest number 
of tokens in the context as possible. So,   
maybe you want to do that. Maybe you want to 
start from scratch. Either one are valid options. 
The sixth pro tip is you’re going to want to 
make sure you’re keeping an eye on this context   
window gauge. So, this gauge shows that for 
the 200k context window of Claude Sonnet 4.5,   
we’ve used about 12%. Now, as this 
conversation grows and grows and   
grows and grows, you also have the option to 
do a slash command in here, like summarize,   
which is going to take your current conversation 
and compact it down to the smallest, smallest bit.   
And this is kind of a pro tip 6.5, but you want 
to be very intentional about how you use that. 
The seventh agent pro tip is that if you 
want visibility into your usage in settings,   
you can toggle usage summary from 
auto, which will only show up when   
you’re close to your limits, to always. 
And you can see it down at the bottom.   
I’ve used 38% of my usage limit. And 
you can also see when that resets. So,   
if you’re a person who’s trying to be very 
cost-conscious, you can see that here. 
The eighth agent pro tip is keyboard shortcuts. 
So, you can use Command I to open up the agent   
window and then Command Slash to change the model 
that you’ve selected. So, maybe I want GPT-5 High   
Fast or maybe I want Claude 4.5 Sonnet. I use 
these two shortcuts all the time, but there   
are a bunch of shortcuts you can configure 
inside of the settings in any way you want. 
The ninth agent pro tip is to start new 
conversations frequently. So, in this past   
conversation around the artist’s photos, I 
used about 12% of the context window. Now,   
something I see a lot of beginners do is they keep 
this conversation going and going and going and   
adding feature after feature after feature 
here to the point where they’re running up   
against the limits of the context window and the 
quality of the model degrades over time as you add   
more stuff into the context. So, I generally 
try to recommend starting new conversations   
for new features. And as a reminder, you can do 
Command N keyboard shortcut to start a new chat. 
The 10th agent pro tip is that you can actually go 
back in time in a conversation with an agent. So,   
we have our top artists here and maybe I decide 
actually I don’t know if I like those numbers   
that big. So, let’s make the numbers for the 
rankings smaller. Sure. And we’re going to go   
and kick off this change and we’ll see what it 
ends up making. Now, if I decide, for example,   
that I don’t like that change, I can just 
go back here and see. They’re a little bit   
smaller. Maybe that’s better. Maybe that’s not. 
Uh, if I decide that I don’t want that change,   
we’ll just let this finish. Great. 
It’s done. I can go back to here. So,   
I can click this button to go back to this 
checkpoint. And it says, do you want to   
discard all changes up to this? Yes. Let’s go back 
here. And now we have our big numbers back. So,   
this can be small changes or you can go very far 
up in a conversation and kind of roll back. Now,   
this is very helpful and I still also recommend 
using and learning about Git. Git helps you   
save those changes in a more persistent way. 
So, you probably want a little bit of both. 
Okay, I know I only said 10, but we’re going 
to do a lightning round with some other really   
fun pro tips. Did you know in settings you 
can have the agent play a completion sound   
when it’s done? You can also have it show 
system notifications when it finishes or   
if there’s some command that you need to give 
permission to run. Pretty nice. Did you also   
know you can ask the agent to generate 
visualizations for your codebase? So,   
I asked it to generate a Mermaid diagram of the 
entire Spotify flow. And look at this. Look how   
detailed this is. The user to app to the API 
endpoints. How the OAuth flow works. What the   
handoff is for access tokens and refresh tokens. 
Pretty nice. Makes it easy for documentation. 
All right, the final final one in our bonus 
lightning round of agent pro tips is the new agent   
layout. So, you can try this out in beta today. 
It’s a new way of working and managing agents in   
your codebase with all of your agents on the left 
sidebar, your main conversation in the middle,   
and then the diffs on the right. 
This can integrate with your browser,   
so it can read network logs, it can look at 
the DOM, you can run terminals from here.   
Everything that you love about the Cursor 
editor, now redesigned for working with   
agents. We’d love your feedback if you try 
this out and stay tuned for the next video.
