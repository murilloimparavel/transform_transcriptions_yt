everyone is talking about mcps it's gone 
completely viral but the reality is most 
people have no idea what mcps are and 
what they mean and what are the startup 
opportunities associated with it so in 
this episode I brought Professor Ross 
Mike who is probably the the best 
explainer of technical Concepts in a 
really easy way that someone who's 
non-technical can really understand I 
brought him on he explains it 
beautifully in such a short amount of 
time and if you stick to the end you'll 
hear a couple of his startup ideas that 
incorporate mcps so um enjoy the episode 
and see you 
[Music] 
soon all right well we got Professor 
Ross Mike on the Pod um and the reason 
why we have him is because I don't know 
what the hell mcps are and I've been 
seeing it on X and I need a succinct 
clear Professor Ross Mike 
explanation um yes I've read a bunch of 
threads on it and I've seen a couple 
videos on it but there's nothing like a 
Ross mic explanation so I'm here for the 
what do I need to know about mcps and 
that's that's what that's why you're 
here thank you for coming on I I I 
appreciate that thank you very much yeah 
class is definitely in session I'll just 
start um sharing my 
screen okay so understanding 
mCP um is 
really um important uh but you'll also 
realize the benefits and why it's sort 
of a big deal but not really at the same 
time you see one of the things in 
programming land that we have and that 
programmers love are standards and the 
reason why standards are important is 
they allow for us Engineers to build 
systems that communicate with each other 
the most popular one that you know you 
might have heard of or you might not and 
you don't really need to know the 
details is rest rest apis and they're 
basically a standard that every company 
follows when they construct their apis 
when they construct their services for 
me as an engineer to be able to connect 
with them now understanding that 
engineering is all about standards and 
having these formalities we follow to 
make life easier when we think of in the 
context of an llm I want you to 
understand this one important thing llms 
by themselves are incapable of doing 
anything meaningful what do I mean by 
that if you remember the first you know 
chat gbt 3 or was it 3.5 I'm not sure 
but if you just open any chat bot and 
you tell it to send you an email um it 
won't know how to do that it will just 
tell you hey I can't send you an email 
the most you can do with an llm is ask 
it questions uh maybe ask it to tell you 
about some historical figure whatever it 
may be right um llms are truly incapable 
of doing anything uh meaningful and what 
I mean by meaningful it'd be nice if you 
know it could send me an email um if it 
could um do some specific task on my 
behalf but the only thing an llm in its 
current state is good at is predicting 
the next text right so for example if I 
say My Big Fat Greek and llm with all 
the data source with all its training 
material will determine that the next 
word is wedding right so this is the 
most an llm by itself that it could do 
right the next Evolution was developers 
figured out how to take llms and combine 
them with tools and you can think of a 
tool like an API for example um most of 
us are aware where chat gbt and these 
other chat Bots are able to search the 
internet for example perplexity right 
perplexity gives you the option to chat 
with an llm but that llm has the ability 
to fetch um information from the 
internet and present that to you the llm 
itself is not capable of doing that but 
what they've done is they've constructed 
a tool they've given the llm access to 
an external service right and there's 
plenty of these Services right I think 
there's Brave search 
um chat open AI offers an API now so 
llms have started to become a bit more 
powerful when we connected tools to them 
right I can give you an example let's 
say um let's say every time I get an 
email I want there to be an entry in a 
spreadsheet now most of you know there 
are services like zapier end8 or you 
know any of those Automation 
Services if I build out an autom 
and connect that to my llm it just 
became a bit more meaningful now that's 
awesome and cool but it gets really 
frustrating when you want to build an 
assistant that does multiple things 
imagine search the internet um read your 
emails summarize this you start to 
become someone who glues a bunch of 
different tools to these llms and it can 
get very frustrating very cumbersome if 
you're wondering why we don't have have 
an Iron Man level Jarvis assistant is 
because combining these tools making it 
work with the llm is one thing but then 
stacking these tools on top of each 
other making it cohesive making it work 
together is a nightmare itself and this 
is where we're currently at and does 
before I continue does this make sense 
this is where we started llms by 
themselves write me a poem um you know 
tell me about World War I um and then 
the second evolution is oh we now have 
tools right we now have um these things 
these external services that we can 
connect to our llm the problem here is 
they're difficult it's annoying and as 
someone who works at an AI startup Tempo 
and we have a lot of tools like for 
example we do a search um you have to 
find an external service you have to 
connect it to the llm and you have to 
make sure the llm doesn't hallucinate or 
do something stupid and believe it or 
not as cool as llms are by themselves 
they're very very dumb um but these 
tools make them just a bit more capable 
so this is where we're at uh Greg we 
good so far crystal clear I'm loving 
this beautiful quick break in the Pod to 
tell you a little bit about startup 
Empire so startup Empire is my private 
membership where it's a bunch of people 
like me like you who want to build out 
their startup ideas now they're looking 
for content to help accelerate that 
they're looking for potential 
co-founders they're looking for uh 
tutorials from people like me to come in 
and tell them how do you do email 
marketing how do you build an audience 
how do you go viral on Twitter all these 
different things that's exactly what 
startup Empire is and it's for people 
who want to start a startup but are 
looking for ideas or it's for people who 
have a startup but just they're not 
seeing the traction uh that they need so 
you can check out the link to Startup 
empire.co in the description now enters 
mCP and what does mCP mean I think the 
simplest way right without getting too 
technicals I've read the threads too and 
as a technical person I appreciate it 
but for the non- Tey I can assume it's 
frustrating think of it this way think 
of every tool that I have to connect to 
to make my llm valuable um as a 
different language so tool one's English 
tool two is Spanish tool three is 
Japanese right and imagine every tool 
it's its own language and it's not that 
there isn't a standard for how apis work 
but every service provider constructs 
their apis differently there's different 
information you have to pass there's 
just various degree of of of of things 
that you have to set up that again it 
just feels like gluing 
a bunch of different things together 
will it work yes but at scale it gets 
very diff difficult mCP you can consider 
it to be a layer between your llm and 
the services and the tools and this 
layer translates all those different 
languages into a unified language that 
makes complete sense to the llm right so 
it's the evolution of llm plus tools but 
in this Evolution it just makes it makes 
it very simple for the llm to connect 
and to access different outside 
resources right because that's what 
tools are at the end of the day so with 
mCP I'm able to connect to an outside 
data source an outside database maybe um 
a tool like uh convex or superbase right 
um imagine I I just tell the llm you 
know what create me a new entry in my 
database and it it's connected to my 
database via mCP and it knows exactly 
what to do and how to do in the second 
evolution llms and tools there's a lot 
of manual work that goes on there's a 
lot of stepbystep planning that you have 
to do and there's a lot of edge cases 
where it can fail and this is why again 
none of us as exciting as the space is 
none of us have a Jarvis level assistant 
yet it feels like we're there and we're 
close but this system makes it so that 
it's very diff and what's frustrating is 
this imagine let me think of a simple 
service a simple like you know tool 
imagine um every time a slack message 
comes your llm reads that slack message 
and it shoots you a text right sounds 
pretty trivial here's the frustrating 
part imagine slack updates their API or 
the text service updates makes a change 
and let's say that service is connected 
to other services or you have some sort 
of like automation step-by-step thing 
that you've 
planned it becomes a nightmare it 
becomes terrifying and this is why even 
in the age of llms good Engineers will 
still get paid because stuff like this 
like this exists but what mCP does it 
unifies the llm and the service right it 
creates this this uh layer where the 
service and the llm can communicate 
efficiently now 
let's get into some practicality you can 
think of the mCP ecosystem as follows 
you have an mCP client you have the 
protocol you have an mCP server and you 
have a service right an mCP client is 
something like Tempo wind surf 
cursor and they are basically the client 
facing side the llm facing side of this 
ecosystem 
the protocol again is that two-way 
connection between the client and the 
server and the server is what translate 
translates that external service its 
capabilities and what it can do to the 
client and that's why between the mCP 
client and the mCP server there's the 
mCP protocol but here's the fascinating 
part and this is why I think anthropic 
they're playing 3D chess when they built 
this is the way this is architected the 
mCP server is now in the hands of the 
service provider so if let's say me and 
Greg run a Dev Tool company right where 
maybe we're doing a database right like 
we're like listen we're going to build 
the best database company in the world 
and we want people's llms to have access 
to this database it is now on us to 
construct this mCP server so that the 
client can fully access this so 
anthropic in a way sort of said listen 
we want our llms to be more powerful 
more capable uh but it's your job to 
figure this out and this is why you've 
noticed all the external service 
providers are now building different mCP 
servers they're building out repos and 
all this stuff right so this is a big 
deal in a sense where llms are going to 
be more capable but from a technological 
perspective all they did was create a 
standard a standard that it seems like 
all companies and all Engineers are 
going to upon because you can construct 
any system any API however you please 
the problem is if you want to scale you 
want to grow you want other developers 
other businesses to connect and work 
with your service it has to be in a 
fashion that makes sense for them 
imagine if all of us just spoke 
different languages but standards allow 
us to communicate in a way that makes 
sense to all of us and mCP is that for 
llms because llms by themselves are not 
that capable they're just they're 
they're they're they're systems that 
have great predictability and they know 
how to predict the next word but when 
you can when you add this mCP protocol 
as a whole you now have a way for it to 
be capable of doing important stuff now 
understanding all this it's not all 
sunshine and rainbows there are some 
technical challenges if you notice if 
anyone has set up an mCP um server on 
any of their favorite mCP clients 
it's annoying um there's a lot of 
downloading you have to move this file 
you have to copy this that and the third 
um and it's a lot of local stuff there 
are some Kinks that have to be figured 
out uh but once this is figured out or 
finalized polished or maybe they update 
the standard or maybe someone comes up 
with a better one we start to enter a 
world where llms start to become more 
capable and that is literally all what 
mCP is just making llms more capable 
we're trying we're doing that with tools 
right now it's kind of working um but 
mCP seems to be the next Evolution I 
think Greg I saw your latest video um 
Manis Manis is a great example of number 
two they have tons of tools and kudos to 
them they've engineer engineered it well 
in a way where you know they well they 
work well cohesively I didn't get to try 
it out so I'm just looking at what 
people have done but I can tell you this 
it's a lot lot of engineering hours it's 
a lot of one change happens something 
broke someone's on call and not sleeping 
but with mCP um it's structured in a way 
where um if we all follow this um 
standard um the llm will have access to 
everything it needs um and we will all 
be happy users so in short that is 
literally all what mCP is it's not um 
Einstein's fifth law of physics or 
anything crazy like that it's literally 
standard for llms and it's exciting it's 
something to be excited about um and 
yeah I hope I hope that clarified I just 
kept ramling so I apologize for that gr 
no no this is this is exactly what I 
wanted I want to end on one question for 
you so this is now clear to me crystal 
clear to me what mcps are but my 
question is well before I even ask my 
question every time there's been a 
popularized protocol for example https 
or uh 
SMTP 
um examples like that there's been a lot 
of big businesses that were created on 
top of it and there's been basically 
this like why now you know why this just 
opening of opportunities yeah the 
average person listening to this 
podcast is building out their 
ideas is this does this matter or you at 
all for that person like yeah I think 
that's a great question I think if I 
were so I'll speak to the technical and 
the non- technical to the technical 
there's a lot of things that a technical 
person can do here I I just don't have 
time Greg but one thing I was thinking 
of was like an mCP App Store and I'll 
just give this idea out for free because 
this this podcast is all about ideas 
basically there's a lot of these repos 
out there um of mCP servers and it'd be 
cool if someone can go on a site I even 
bought the domain um it does nothing but 
again please anybody like steal this 
idea um um I bought the domain and it'd 
be cool if someone could um go on U like 
look at the different mCP servers there 
they they see the GitHub code and 
whatever and they can click like install 
or deploy and they that server is 
deployed and gives them a specific URL 
and then they can paste that in an mCP 
client and work that out so for the 
technical person if you make millions 
all I ask is just you know send me ,000 
but for the non-technical person what I 
would really focus on is I would just 
stay up to date with the platforms that 
are building out mCP capability and just 
see where the standards are going right 
because like you said um when these 
standards are finalized I don't know if 
mCP has fully won I think it needs to be 
challenged um or I don't know if 
anthropic is going to make an update we 
don't know it's very early but I would 
say keep very close attention to what 
the final standard is going to be 
because once that standard is finalized 
and all these service providers start to 
like you know build out their mCP or 
whatever thing it is you can now start 
to integrate much seamlessly and much 
easier right this is why again every 
week There's a new chatbot interface 
with new tools and it wins because this 
part step number two is not easy right 
especially making it cohesive and making 
it work fast right like I can sit in two 
hours and build something like this but 
building out that user experience making 
it Flawless limiting the hallucinations 
it's very very hard I mean this is a lot 
of the work we do at Tempo but this 
makes it so that integrating is a lot 
easier and you can think of these as 
like Lego pieces that you can continue 
to stack to stack so for my smart and 
wise business owners startup uh ideas 
podcast enjoyers I would really just 
keep a close attention right I think 
even for myself I don't think with this 
mCP stuff we're at a place where any 
shots can be fired that make um any 
smart business decision but this is one 
of those things where you just you sit 
and you watch and you're just observing 
and learning and when the right thing at 
the right time happens you strike so I 
don't see any crazy business 
opportunities right now for a 
non-technical person even for a 
technical person like imagine if open AI 
comes with a standard tomorrow and we 
all just shift to that right it's very 
early stages but I think understanding 
how this works means you'll understand 
how the next thing works and when that 
becomes fin finalized you hit the ground 
running amen all 
right Ross Mike Professor Ross Mike 
there's no one like you we'll include in 
the show notes where you can follow him 
for more really clear explanations 
around this whole AI coding world and uh 
dude I'll see you in Miami in a few 
weeks yeah man I appreciate you I'm 
booking my flight soon so yeah 
definitely bro I'll see you soon thank 
you everybody
